 Project_Gutenberg Etext_of Hamlet_by Shakespeare
 ******This file should_be named 1524.txt or 1524.zip******
 This_etext was_prepared by_Dianne Bean.

 Project_Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions, all of which are in_the Public Domain in_the United States, unless a_copyright notice is included. Therefore, we usually do NOT! keep these books in compliance with any particular paper edition.

 We_are now trying to release all_our books one month in advance of_the official_release dates, leaving time for better editing.

 Please note: neither this list nor its contents are final till midnight of_the last_day of_the month of any such announcement. The official_release date of_all Project_Gutenberg Etexts is_at Midnight, Central Time, of_the last_day of_the stated month. A preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment and editing by those who wish_to do so. To_be sure you_have an up_to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes in_the first week of_the next month. Since our ftp program has a bug in it_that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a_look at_the file size will_have to_do, but_we will_try to_see a_new copy has at least one byte more_or less.

 Information about Project_Gutenberg (one page)

 We produce about two million_dollars for each hour we work. The_time it_takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours to_get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright searched and analyzed, the_copyright letters written, etc. This projected audience is_one hundred_million readers. If our value per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2 million_dollars per hour this year as_we release thirty-six text files per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for_a total of 2000+ If these reach just 10% of_the computerized population, then_the total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.

 The Goal of_Project Gutenberg is_to Give Away One Trillion Etext Files by December 31, 2001. [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion] This_is ten_thousand titles each to_one hundred_million readers, which_is only ~5% of_the present number of computer users.

 At our revised rates of production, we_will reach only one-third of_that goal by_the end_of 2001, or_about 3,333 Etexts unless we manage to_get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly from Michael Hart's salary at_Carnegie-Mellon University, and_an assortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is_only good for_a few more years, so we_are looking for something to replace it,_as we don't want Project_Gutenberg to_be so dependent on one person.

 We_need your donations more_than ever!

 All donations should_be made_to "Project Gutenberg/CMU": and are tax deductible to_the extent allowable by law. (CMU = Carnegie- Mellon University).

 ACT I.

 Scene_I. Elsinore._A platform before_the Castle.

 [Francisco at_his post. Enter to_him Bernardo.]

 Ber.
 Who's there?
 Fran.
 Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.
 Ber.
 Long live_the king!
 Fran.
 Bernardo?
 Ber.
 He.
 Fran.
 You come most carefully upon_your hour.
 Ber.
 'Tis_now struck twelve. Get_thee to_bed, Francisco.
 Fran.
 For_this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
 And_I am sick at heart.
 Ber.
 Have_you had quiet guard?
 Fran.
 Not_a mouse stirring.
 Ber.
 Well, good_night.
 If_you do meet Horatio_and Marcellus,
 The rivals of_my watch, bid them make_haste.
 Fran.
 I_think I_hear them.—Stand, ho! Who_is there?
 [Enter_Horatio and_Marcellus.]

 Hor.
 Friends to_this ground.
 Mar.
 And liegemen to_the Dane.
 Fran.
 Give_you good-night.
 Mar.
 O, farewell, honest soldier;
 Who hath reliev'd you?
 Fran.
 Bernardo has_my place.
 Give_you good-night.
 [Exit.]

 Mar.
 Holla! Bernardo!
 Ber.
 Say.
 What, is Horatio there?
 Hor.
 A piece_of him.
 Ber.
 Welcome, Horatio:—Welcome, good Marcellus.
 Mar.
 What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
 Ber.
 I_have seen nothing.
 Mar.
 Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
 And_will not_let belief take hold of him
 Touching_this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
 Therefore I_have entreated him along
 With us_to watch the minutes of_this night;
 That, if again this apparition come
 He_may approve our eyes_and speak_to it.
 Hor.
 Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
 Ber.
 Sit down awhile,
 And_let us once again assail your ears,
 That_are so fortified against our story,
 What we two nights have seen.
 Hor.
 Well, sit we down,
 And_let us hear Bernardo speak_of this.
 Ber.
 Last night of all,
 When yond same star that's westward from_the pole
 Had made his course to illume that part_of heaven
 Where now it burns, Marcellus_and myself,
 The bell then beating one,—
 Mar.
 Peace, break thee off; look_where it_comes again!
 [Enter Ghost, armed.]

 Ber.
 In_the same figure, like_the king that's dead.
 Mar.
 Thou art_a scholar; speak_to it,_Horatio.
 Ber.
 Looks it_not like_the King? mark it,_Horatio.
 Hor.
 Most like:—it harrows me_with fear_and wonder.
 Ber.
 It_would be spoke to.
 Mar.
 Question it,_Horatio.
 Hor.
 What art thou, that usurp'st this_time of_night,
 Together_with that fair_and warlike form
 In which the majesty_of buried Denmark
 Did sometimes march? By heaven I_charge thee, speak!
 Mar.
 It_is offended.
 Ber.
 See, it stalks away!
 Hor.
 Stay! speak, speak! I_charge thee speak!
 [Exit_Ghost.]

 Mar.
 'Tis gone, and_will not answer.
 Ber.
 How_now, Horatio! You tremble and_look pale:
 Is_not this something more_than fantasy?
 What_think you_on't?
 Hor.
 Before_my God,_I might_not this believe
 Without_the sensible and true avouch
 Of mine_own eyes.
 Mar.
 Is_it not_like the_King?
 Hor.
 As thou_art to thyself:
 Such was_the very armour he_had on
 When_he the_ambitious Norway combated;
 So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,
 He smote the sledded Polacks on_the ice.
 'Tis strange.
 Mar.
 Thus twice before, and jump at_this dead hour,
 With martial stalk hath_he gone by_our watch.
 Hor.
 In what particular thought_to work I_know not;
 But,_in the gross and scope of_my opinion,
 This bodes some strange eruption to_our state.
 Mar.
 Good now, sit down, and_tell me, he_that knows,
 Why this_same strict and_most observant watch
 So nightly toils the subject of_the land;
 And why such daily cast_of brazen cannon,
 And foreign mart for implements of war;
 Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
 Does not divide the Sunday from_the week;
 What_might be toward, that_this sweaty haste
 Doth make_the night joint-labourer with_the day:
 Who is't that_can inform me?
 Hor.
 That_can I;
 At_least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
 Whose image even but_now appear'd to_us,
 Was, as_you know, by Fortinbras of_Norway,
 Thereto prick'd on_by a_most emulate pride,
 Dar'd to_the combat; in_which our valiant Hamlet,—
 For so this side of_our known world esteem'd him,—
 Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by_a seal'd compact,
 Well ratified by law and heraldry,
 Did forfeit, with_his life, all those his lands,
 Which he stood seiz'd of, to_the conqueror:
 Against the which, a moiety competent
 Was gaged by_our king; which had return'd
 To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
 Had_he been vanquisher; as by_the same cov'nant,
 And carriage of_the article design'd,
 His fell to_Hamlet. Now, sir, young_Fortinbras,
 Of unimproved mettle hot_and full,
 Hath in_the skirts of_Norway, here_and there,
 Shark'd up_a list_of lawless resolutes,
 For food and diet, to_some enterprise
 That_hath a stomach in't; which_is no other,—
 As_it doth well appear unto our state,—
 But_to recover of_us, by strong hand,
 And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
 So by_his father lost: and this, I_take it,
 Is_the main motive of_our preparations,
 The source_of this our watch, and_the chief head
 Of_this post-haste and romage in_the land.
 Ber.
 I_think it_be no_other but e'en_so:
 Well may it sort, that_this portentous figure
 Comes armed through_our watch; so like_the king
 That was and is_the question_of these wars.
 Hor.
 A mote it_is to trouble the mind's eye.
 In_the most high and palmy state_of Rome,
 A_little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
 The graves stood tenantless, and_the sheeted dead
 Did squeak and gibber in_the Roman streets;
 As, stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
 Disasters in_the sun; and_the moist star,
 Upon_whose influence Neptune's empire stands,
 Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
 And even the like precurse of fierce events,—
 As harbingers preceding still the fates,
 And prologue_to the omen coming on,—
 Have heaven_and earth together demonstrated
 Unto our climature and countrymen.—
 But, soft, behold! lo, where_it comes_again!
 [Re-enter Ghost.]

 I'll cross it,_though it blast me.—Stay, illusion!
 If_thou hast any sound, or use_of voice,
 Speak_to me:
 If there_be any good thing_to be done,
 That may to thee do ease, and, race to_me,
 Speak_to me:
 If_thou art privy to_thy country's fate,
 Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid,
 O, speak!
 Or if_thou hast uphoarded in_thy life
 Extorted treasure in_the womb of earth,
 For which, they_say, you spirits oft walk in_death,
 [The cock crows.]
 Speak of it:—stay, and speak!—Stop it, Marcellus!
 Mar.
 Shall_I strike at it_with my partisan?
 Hor.
 Do, if_it will_not stand.
 Ber.
 'Tis_here!
 Hor.
 'Tis_here!
 Mar.
 'Tis gone!
 [Exit_Ghost.]

 We do_it wrong, being so majestical,
 To offer it the show_of violence;
 For it_is, as_the air, invulnerable,
 And_our vain blows malicious mockery.
 Ber.
 It_was about_to speak, when_the cock crew.
 Hor.
 And_then it started, like_a guilty thing
 Upon_a fearful summons. I_have heard
 The cock, that_is the_trumpet to_the morn,
 Doth with_his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
 Awake the god of day; and at_his warning,
 Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
 The extravagant and erring spirit hies
 To_his confine: and of_the truth herein
 This present object made probation.
 Mar.
 It faded on_the crowing of_the cock.
 Some say that_ever 'gainst that season comes
 Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
 The bird of dawning singeth all night long;
 And_then, they_say, no spirit dare stir abroad;
 The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
 No fairy takes, nor witch hath_power to charm;
 So hallow'd and_so gracious is_the time.
 Hor.
 So have_I heard,_and do in_part believe_it.
 But,_look, the_morn, in russet mantle clad,
 Walks o'er_the dew_of yon high eastward hill:
 Break we our watch up: and_by my advice,
 Let_us impart what_we have_seen to-night
 Unto young Hamlet; for, upon_my life,
 This spirit, dumb to_us, will_speak to_him:
 Do_you consent we_shall acquaint him_with it,
 As needful in_our loves, fitting our duty?
 Mar.
 Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
 Where we_shall find_him most conveniently.
 [Exeunt.]

 Scene_II. Elsinore._A room of state in_the Castle.

 [Enter the King,_Queen, Hamlet, Polonius, Laertes, Voltimand,
 Cornelius, Lords, and Attendant.]
 King.
 Though yet of_Hamlet our dear_brother's death
 The memory be green, and that_it us befitted
 To_bear our hearts in grief, and_our whole kingdom
 To_be contracted in_one brow of woe;
 Yet so_far hath discretion fought with nature
 That_we with wisest sorrow think on_him,
 Together_with remembrance of ourselves.
 Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
 Th' imperial jointress to_this warlike state,
 Have we, as_'twere with_a defeated joy,—
 With_an auspicious and one dropping eye,
 With mirth in funeral, and_with dirge in marriage,
 In equal scale weighing delight and dole,—
 Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd
 Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
 With_this affair along:—or all, our thanks.
 Now follows, that_you know, young_Fortinbras,
 Holding a weak supposal of_our worth,
 Or thinking by_our late dear_brother's death
 Our state to_be disjoint and_out of frame,
 Colleagued with_this dream_of his advantage,
 He_hath not fail'd to pester us_with message,
 Importing the surrender of those lands
 Lost by_his father, with_all bonds of law,
 To our most valiant brother. So_much for him,—
 Now for ourself and for_this time_of meeting:
 Thus much the_business is:—we have here writ
 To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,—
 Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
 Of_this his nephew's purpose,—to suppress
 His further gait herein; in_that the levies,
 The lists, and full proportions are_all made
 Out_of his subject:—and we here dispatch
 You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
 For bearers of_this greeting to_old Norway;
 Giving to you no_further personal power
 To business with_the king, more_than the scope
 Of these dilated articles allow.
 Farewell; and let_your haste commend your duty.
 Cor. and Volt.
 In that and_all things will we show our duty.
 King.
 We doubt_it nothing: heartily farewell.
 [Exeunt_Voltimand and_Cornelius.]

 And_now, Laertes, what's_the news with you?
 You told us of_some suit; what is't,_Laertes?
 You_cannot speak_of reason to_the Dane,
 And_lose your voice: what wouldst_thou beg, Laertes,
 That shall_not be my offer, not_thy asking?
 The_head is_not more native to_the heart,
 The hand more instrumental to_the mouth,
 Than_is the throne of_Denmark to_thy father.
 What wouldst_thou have, Laertes?
 Laer.
 Dread my_lord,
 Your leave_and favour to return to France;
 From whence though willingly I_came to Denmark,
 To_show my_duty in_your coronation;
 Yet now, I_must confess, that duty done,
 My_thoughts and wishes bend again toward France,
 And bow them_to your_gracious leave_and pardon.
 King.
 Have_you your_father's leave? What says Polonius?
 Pol.
 He_hath, my_lord, wrung from_me my slow leave
 By laboursome petition; and at last
 Upon his_will I seal'd my hard consent:
 I_do beseech_you, give_him leave_to go.
 King.
 Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
 And_thy best graces spend it_at thy will!—
 But now,_my cousin Hamlet,_and my son—
 Ham.
 [Aside.] A_little more_than kin, and less than kind!
 King.
 How_is it_that the_clouds still hang_on you?
 Ham.
 Not so,_my lord;_I am too_much i'_the sun.
 Queen.
 Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
 And_let thine eye look like_a friend on Denmark.
 Do_not for ever with thy vailed lids
 Seek for_thy noble_father in_the dust:
 Thou_know'st 'tis common,—all that lives must die,
 Passing through nature to eternity.
 Ham.
 Ay, madam, it_is common.
 Queen.
 If_it be,
 Why seems_it so particular with thee?
 Ham.
 Seems, madam! Nay, it_is; I_know not seems.
 'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good_mother,
 Nor customary suits_of solemn black,
 Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
 No,_nor the fruitful river in_the eye,
 Nor_the dejected 'havior of_the visage,
 Together_with all_forms, moods, shows of grief,
 That_can denote me truly: these, indeed, seem;
 For they_are actions that a_man might play;
 But_I have that within which passeth show;
 These but_the trappings and_the suits_of woe.
 King.
 'Tis sweet and commendable in_your nature, Hamlet,
 To_give these mourning duties to_your father;
 But, you_must know, your_father lost a father;
 That father lost, lost his; and_the survivor bound,
 In filial obligation, for_some term
 To do obsequious sorrow: but_to persevere
 In obstinate condolement is_a course
 Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;
 It shows_a will_most incorrect to_heaven;
 A heart unfortified, a mind impatient;
 An understanding simple and unschool'd;
 For_what we_know must be, and is as common
 As any the_most vulgar thing_to sense,
 Why_should we, in_our peevish opposition,
 Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis_a fault_to heaven,
 A fault against_the dead, a_fault to nature,
 To reason most absurd; whose common theme
 Is death_of fathers, and_who still hath cried,
 From_the first corse till_he that died to-day,
 'This must_be so.' We pray_you, throw to earth
 This unprevailing woe; and_think of_us
 As of_a father: for let_the world take note
 You_are the_most immediate to_our throne;
 And_with no_less nobility of_love
 Than that_which dearest father bears his son
 Do I impart toward you. For_your intent
 In going back_to school in Wittenberg,
 It_is most retrograde to_our desire:
 And_we beseech_you bend you_to remain
 Here_in the cheer_and comfort of_our eye,
 Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and_our son.
 Queen.
 Let_not thy_mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:
 I_pray thee stay with us; go_not to Wittenberg.
 Ham.
 I_shall in all_my best obey you, madam.
 King.
 Why,_'tis a loving and_a fair reply:
 Be as ourself in Denmark.—Madam, come;
 This gentle and unforc'd accord of_Hamlet
 Sits smiling to_my heart: in grace whereof,
 No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day
 But the_great cannon_to the_clouds shall tell;
 And the_king's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,
 Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.
 [Exeunt_all but_Hamlet.]

 Ham.
 O that_this too too solid flesh would melt,
 Thaw, and resolve itself into_a dew!
 Or that the Everlasting had_not fix'd
 His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O_God! O_God!
 How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
 Seem to_me all_the uses of_this world!
 Fie on't! O fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,
 That grows to seed; things rank_and gross in nature
 Possess it merely. That_it should come_to this!
 But two_months dead!—nay, not_so much, not two:
 So excellent a king; that was, to this,
 Hyperion to_a satyr; so loving to_my mother,
 That_he might_not beteem the_winds of_heaven
 Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
 Must I remember? Why, she would hang_on him
 As_if increase of appetite had grown
 By what_it fed on: and yet, within_a month,—
 Let_me not_think on't,—Frailty, thy name is woman!—
 A_little month; or_ere those shoes were old
 With which she followed my poor father's body
 Like Niobe, all tears;—why she, even she,—
 O_God! a_beast that wants discourse of_reason,
 Would_have mourn'd longer,—married with_mine uncle,
 My_father's brother; but_no more like my_father
 Than I to Hercules: within_a month;
 Ere yet the salt of_most unrighteous tears
 Had left the flushing in_her galled eyes,
 She married:— O,_most wicked speed, to post
 With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
 It_is not, nor it_cannot come_to good;
 But break my heart,—for I_must hold_my tongue!
 [Enter Horatio,_Marcellus, and_Bernardo.]

 Hor.
 Hail to_your lordship!
 Ham.
 I_am glad_to see you well:
 Horatio,—or I_do forget myself.
 Hor.
 The same, my_lord, and your poor servant ever.
 Ham.
 Sir, my_good friend; I'll change that name with_you:
 And_what make_you from Wittenberg, Horatio?—
 Marcellus?
 Mar.
 My good_lord,—
 Ham.
 I_am very glad_to see you.—Good even, sir.—
 But what, in_faith, make_you from Wittenberg?
 Hor.
 A truant disposition, good_my lord.
 Ham.
 I_would not hear your enemy say so;
 Nor shall you_do my ear that violence,
 To_make it truster of_your own report
 Against yourself: I_know you_are no truant.
 But_what is_your affair in Elsinore?
 We'll teach_you to drink deep ere_you depart.
 Hor.
 My_lord, I_came to_see your_father's funeral.
 Ham.
 I prithee do_not mock_me, fellow-student.
 I_think it_was to_see my mother's wedding.
 Hor.
 Indeed,_my lord,_it follow'd hard upon.
 Ham.
 Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats
 Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
 Would I_had met my dearest foe in_heaven
 Or ever_I had_seen that day, Horatio!—
 My father,—methinks I_see my_father.
 Hor.
 Where, my_lord?
 Ham.
 In_my mind's eye, Horatio.
 Hor.
 I_saw him once; he_was a goodly king.
 Ham.
 He_was a_man, take_him for all in all,
 I_shall not_look upon_his like again.
 Hor.
 My_lord, I_think I_saw him yesternight.
 Ham.
 Saw who?
 Hor.
 My_lord, the_king your_father.
 Ham.
 The_King my_father!
 Hor.
 Season your admiration for awhile
 With_an attent ear, till_I may deliver,
 Upon_the witness of_these gentlemen,
 This marvel to_you.
 Ham.
 For God's love let_me hear.
 Hor.
 Two nights together had these_gentlemen,
 Marcellus_and Bernardo, on their watch
 In_the dead vast and middle_of the_night,
 Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your_father,
 Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
 Appears before them and_with solemn march
 Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd
 By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
 Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distill'd
 Almost to jelly with_the act of fear,
 Stand dumb, and_speak not_to him. This to_me
 In dreadful secrecy impart they_did;
 And_I with_them the_third night kept_the watch:
 Where, as_they had deliver'd, both_in time,
 Form of_the thing, each word made true and good,
 The apparition comes: I_knew your_father;
 These hands are_not more like.
 Ham.
 But_where was this?
 Mar.
 My_lord, upon_the platform where we watch'd.
 Ham.
 Did_you not_speak to it?
 Hor.
 My_lord, I did;
 But answer made_it none: yet once methought
 It lifted up it head, and did address
 Itself to motion, like as_it would speak:
 But_even then_the morning cock crew loud,
 And_at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
 And vanish'd from_our sight.
 Ham.
 'Tis very strange.
 Hor.
 As_I do live, my honour'd_lord, 'tis true;
 And_we did think_it writ down in_our duty
 To_let you_know of_it.
 Ham.
 Indeed, indeed, sirs, but_this troubles me.
 Hold you the watch to-night?
 Mar._and Ber.
 We do,_my lord.
 Ham.
 Arm'd, say_you?
 Both.
 Arm'd, my_lord.
 Ham.
 From top to toe?
 Both.
 My_lord, from head_to foot.
 Ham.
 Then saw_you not_his face?
 Hor.
 O, yes, my_lord: he wore his beaver up.
 Ham.
 What, look'd he frowningly?
 Hor.
 A countenance more_in sorrow than_in anger.
 Ham.
 Pale or red?
 Hor.
 Nay, very pale.
 Ham.
 And fix'd his eyes upon you?
 Hor.
 Most constantly.
 Ham.
 I_would I_had been there.
 Hor.
 It_would have_much amaz'd you.
 Ham.
 Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
 Hor.
 While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
 Mar._and Ber.
 Longer, longer.
 Hor.
 Not when_I saw't.
 Ham.
 His_beard was grizzled,—no?
 Hor.
 It was, as_I have_seen it_in his_life,
 A sable silver'd.
 Ham.
 I_will watch to-night;
 Perchance 'twill walk again.
 Hor.
 I warr'nt it will.
 Ham.
 If_it assume my_noble father's person,
 I'll_speak to_it, though hell_itself should gape
 And bid me hold_my peace. I_pray you all,
 If_you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
 Let_it be tenable in_your silence still;
 And whatsoever else_shall hap to-night,
 Give it_an understanding, but_no tongue:
 I_will requite your loves. So, fare ye well:
 Upon_the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
 I'll visit you.
 All.
 Our duty_to your_honour.
 Ham.
 Your loves, as mine to_you: farewell.
 [Exeunt Horatio,_Marcellus, and_Bernardo.]

 My_father's spirit in arms! All is_not well;
 I_doubt some foul play: would the_night were come!
 Till_then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,
 Though all_the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
 [Exit.]

 Scene_III. A_room in_Polonius's house.

 [Enter Laertes and Ophelia.]

 Laer.
 My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:
 And, sister, as_the winds give benefit
 And convoy is assistant, do_not sleep,
 But_let me hear from you.
 Oph.
 Do_you doubt that?
 Laer.
 For Hamlet,_and the trifling of_his favour,
 Hold it a fashion, and_a toy in blood:
 A violet in_the youth of primy nature,
 Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting;
 The perfume and suppliance of_a minute;
 No_more.
 Oph.
 No_more but so?
 Laer.
 Think it_no more:
 For nature, crescent, does not grow alone
 In thews and bulk; but as_this temple waxes,
 The inward service_of the_mind and_soul
 Grows wide withal. Perhaps he_loves you_now;
 And_now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
 The virtue_of his will: but you_must fear,
 His greatness weigh'd, his_will is_not his own;
 For_he himself is subject to_his birth:
 He_may not,_as unvalu'd persons do,
 Carve for himself; for on_his choice depends
 The safety_and health of_this whole state;
 And_therefore must his_choice be circumscrib'd
 Unto the_voice and yielding of_that body
 Whereof he_is the_head. Then if_he says he_loves you,
 It fits your wisdom so_far to believe_it
 As_he in_his particular act and place
 May give his saying deed; which_is no_further
 Than the_main voice_of Denmark goes withal.
 Then weigh what loss your_honour may sustain
 If with too credent ear you list his songs,
 Or lose_your heart, or your chaste treasure open
 To_his unmaster'd importunity.
 Fear it, Ophelia, fear it,_my dear sister;
 And keep you_in the rear of_your affection,
 Out_of the shot and_danger of desire.
 The chariest maid is prodigal enough
 If_she unmask her beauty to_the moon:
 Virtue_itself scopes not calumnious strokes:
 The canker galls the infants of_the spring
 Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd:
 And_in the morn and liquid dew_of youth
 Contagious blastments are_most imminent.
 Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
 Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
 Oph.
 I_shall th' effect_of this good lesson keep
 As watchman to_my heart. But,_good my brother,
 Do_not, as some ungracious pastors do,
 Show me the steep and thorny way to_heaven;
 Whilst, like_a puff'd and reckless libertine,
 Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads
 And recks not_his own read.
 Laer.
 O, fear me not.
 I stay too long:—but here my_father comes.
 [Enter_Polonius.]

 A double blessing is_a double grace;
 Occasion smiles upon_a second leave.
 Pol.
 Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for_shame!
 The wind sits in_the shoulder of_your sail,
 And you_are stay'd for. There,—my blessing with thee!
 [Laying his hand on Laertes's head.]

 And these few precepts in_thy memory
 Look thou character. Give thy_thoughts no_tongue,
 Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
 Be_thou familiar, but_by no_means vulgar.
 Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
 Grapple them unto thy_soul with hoops of steel;
 But_do not dull thy palm with entertainment
 Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware
 Of entrance to_a quarrel; but, being in,
 Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.
 Give every_man thine ear, but few thy voice:
 Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
 Costly thy habit_as thy purse can buy,
 But_not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy:
 For_the apparel oft proclaims the_man;
 And_they in France of_the best rank_and station
 Are most select and generous chief in_that.
 Neither a borrower nor a lender be:
 For loan oft loses both itself and friend;
 And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
 This above all,—to thine_own self be true;
 And it must follow, as_the night the day,
 Thou canst not then be false to_any man.
 Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!
 Laer.
 Most humbly do_I take_my leave, my_lord.
 Pol.
 The_time invites you; go, your servants tend.
 Laer.
 Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well
 What I_have said_to you.
 Oph.
 'Tis in_my memory lock'd,
 And you_yourself shall_keep the key of_it.
 Laer.
 Farewell.
 [Exit.]

 Pol.
 What_is't, Ophelia, he_hath said_to you?
 Oph.
 So please_you, something touching the_Lord Hamlet.
 Pol.
 Marry,_well bethought:
 'Tis told me he_hath very oft of_late
 Given private time_to you;_and you_yourself
 Have of_your audience been most free and bounteous;
 If_it be so,—as so 'tis put_on me,
 And_that in way_of caution,—I must_tell you
 You_do not_understand yourself so clearly
 As_it behooves my_daughter and your_honour.
 What_is between you? give_me up_the truth.
 Oph.
 He_hath, my_lord, of_late made many tenders
 Of_his affection to_me.
 Pol.
 Affection! pooh! you_speak like_a green girl,
 Unsifted in_such perilous circumstance.
 Do_you believe_his tenders, as_you call them?
 Oph.
 I_do not know, my_lord, what_I should think.
 Pol.
 Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;
 That_you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
 Which are_not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;
 Or,—not to crack the_wind of_the poor phrase,
 Wronging it thus,—you'll tender me_a fool.
 Oph.
 My_lord, he_hath importun'd me_with love
 In honourable fashion.
 Pol.
 Ay, fashion you_may call it; go to, go to.
 Oph.
 And_hath given countenance to_his speech,_my lord,
 With almost all_the holy vows of heaven.
 Pol.
 Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I_do know,
 When_the blood burns, how prodigal the_soul
 Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,
 Giving more light than heat,—extinct in both,
 Even in_their promise, as_it is a-making,—
 You_must not take for fire. From this_time
 Be something scanter of_your maiden presence;
 Set your entreatments at_a higher rate
 Than a command_to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
 Believe so_much in him,_that he_is young;
 And_with a larger tether may he walk
 Than may_be given you: in few, Ophelia,
 Do_not believe_his vows; for_they are brokers,—
 Not of_that dye which their investments show,
 But mere implorators of unholy suits,
 Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
 The better to beguile. This_is for all,—
 I_would not, in plain terms, from_this time forth
 Have_you so slander any moment leisure
 As_to give words or talk with_the Lord_Hamlet.
 Look to't, I_charge you; come_your ways.
 Oph.
 I_shall obey, my_lord.
 [Exeunt.]

 Scene_IV. The platform.

 [Enter_Hamlet, Horatio, and_Marcellus.]

 Ham.
 The air bites shrewdly; it_is very cold.
 Hor.
 It_is a nipping and_an eager air.
 Ham.
 What hour now?
 Hor.
 I_think it lacks of twelve.
 Mar.
 No, it_is struck.
 Hor.
 Indeed? I_heard it not: then draws near_the season
 Wherein the spirit held his wont_to walk.
 [A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot_off within.]

 What does this_mean, my_lord?

 Ham.
 The_King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
 Keeps wassail, and_the swaggering up-spring reels;
 And,_as he drains his draughts of_Rhenish down,
 The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out
 The triumph of_his pledge.
 Hor.
 Is_it a custom?
 Ham.
 Ay,_marry, is't;
 But_to my mind,—though I_am native here,
 And to_the manner born,—it is_a custom
 More honour'd in_the breach than_the observance.
 This heavy-headed revel east and west
 Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations:
 They clepe us drunkards, and_with swinish phrase
 Soil our addition; and, indeed,_it takes
 From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
 The pith_and marrow of_our attribute.
 So oft it chances in particular men
 That,_for some vicious mole of_nature in them,
 As in_their birth,—wherein they_are not guilty,
 Since_nature cannot_choose his origin,—
 By_the o'ergrowth of_some complexion,
 Oft breaking down_the pales and forts of reason;
 Or_by some habit, that too_much o'er-leavens
 The form_of plausive manners;—that these men,—
 Carrying, I_say, the_stamp of_one defect,
 Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,—
 Their virtues else,—be they as_pure as grace,
 As infinite as man_may undergo,—
 Shall in_the general censure take corruption
 From that particular fault: the dram of eale
 Doth all_the noble substance often doubt
 To_his own scandal.
 Hor.
 Look, my_lord, it comes!
 [Enter_Ghost.]

 Ham.
 Angels and ministers of_grace defend us!—
 Be_thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
 Bring with thee airs from_heaven or blasts from hell,
 Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
 Thou com'st in_such a questionable shape
 That_I will_speak to_thee: I'll_call thee Hamlet,
 King, father, royal Dane; O, answer me!
 Let_me not burst in ignorance; but tell
 Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in_death,
 Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,
 Wherein we saw_thee quietly in-urn'd,
 Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
 To_cast thee up again! What may this_mean,
 That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,
 Revisit'st thus_the glimpses of_the moon,
 Making night hideous, and_we fools of_nature
 So horridly to shake our disposition
 With thoughts beyond the reaches of_our souls?
 Say, why_is this? wherefore? what_should we do?
 [Ghost beckons Hamlet.]

 Hor.
 It beckons you_to go away_with it,
 As_if it_some impartment did desire
 To_you alone.
 Mar.
 Look with what courteous action
 It_waves you_to a_more removed ground:
 But_do not go_with it!
 Hor.
 No,_by no means.
 Ham.
 It_will not speak; then will I_follow it.
 Hor.
 Do_not, my_lord.
 Ham.
 Why,_what should_be the fear?
 I_do not set my_life at_a pin's fee;
 And_for my_soul, what_can it do to that,
 Being a_thing immortal as itself?
 It_waves me forth again;—I'll follow_it.
 Hor.
 What_if it tempt_you toward the flood, my_lord,
 Or_to the_dreadful summit_of the cliff
 That beetles o'er_his base into_the sea,
 And_there assume some other horrible form
 Which might deprive your sovereignty of_reason,
 And draw you into madness? think_of it:
 The_very place puts toys of desperation,
 Without more motive, into every brain
 That looks_so many fadoms to_the sea
 And hears it roar beneath.
 Ham.
 It_waves me still.—
 Go on;_I'll follow_thee.
 Mar.
 You_shall not_go, my_lord.
 Ham.
 Hold off your hands.
 Hor.
 Be rul'd; you_shall not go.
 Ham.
 My fate cries out,
 And_makes each petty artery in_this body
 As hardy as_the Nemean lion's nerve.—
 [Ghost beckons.]

 Still am_I call'd;—unhand me, gentlemen;—

 [Breaking free_from them.]

 By_heaven, I'll_make a ghost of him_that lets me!—
 I_say, away!—Go on;_I'll follow_thee.
 [Exeunt Ghost_and Hamlet.]

 Hor.
 He waxes desperate with imagination.
 Mar.
 Let's follow; 'tis_not fit thus to obey him.
 Hor.
 Have after.—To what issue will_this come?
 Mar.
 Something is rotten in_the state_of Denmark.
 Hor.
 Heaven will direct it.
 Mar.
 Nay, let's follow him.
 [Exeunt.]

 Scene_V. A more remote part_of the_Castle.

 [Enter Ghost_and Hamlet.]

 Ham.
 Whither wilt_thou lead me? speak! I'll_go no further.
 Ghost.
 Mark me.
 Ham.
 I will.
 Ghost.
 My hour is almost come,
 When_I to sulph'uous and tormenting flames
 Must render up myself.
 Ham.
 Alas,_poor ghost!
 Ghost.
 Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
 To_what I_shall unfold.
 Ham.
 Speak; I_am bound to_hear.
 Ghost.
 So art_thou to revenge, when_thou shalt hear.
 Ham.
 What?
 Ghost.
 I_am thy_father's spirit;
 Doom'd for_a certain term to walk the_night,
 And_for the_day confin'd to wastein fires,
 Till_the foul crimes done_in my days_of nature
 Are burnt and purg'd away. But_that I_am forbid
 To_tell the secrets of_my prison-house,
 I_could a_tale unfold whose lightest word
 Would harrow up thy soul; freeze thy young blood;
 Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres;
 Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
 And each particular hair to stand on end
 Like quills upon_the fretful porcupine:
 But_this eternal blazon must_not be
 To ears_of flesh and blood.—List, list, O, list!—
 If_thou didst_ever thy dear_father love—
 Ham.
 O_God!
 Ghost.
 Revenge his foul_and most unnatural murder.
 Ham.
 Murder!
 Ghost.
 Murder most_foul, as in_the best it_is;
 But_this most_foul, strange, and unnatural.
 Ham.
 Haste me_to know't, that I, with wings as swift
 As meditation or_the thoughts of_love,
 May sweep to_my revenge.
 Ghost.
 I find thee apt;
 And duller shouldst thou_be than_the fat weed
 That rots itself_in ease on Lethe wharf,
 Wouldst thou not stir in_this. Now,_Hamlet, hear.
 'Tis given out that, sleeping in_my orchard,
 A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of_Denmark
 Is by_a forged process of_my death
 Rankly abus'd; but know, thou noble youth,
 The serpent that_did sting thy_father's life
 Now wears his crown.
 Ham.
 O_my prophetic soul!
 Mine uncle!
 Ghost.
 Ay,_that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
 With witchcraft of_his wit, with traitorous gifts,—
 O wicked wit and gifts, that_have the_power
 So to seduce!—won to_his shameful lust
 The will of_my most seeming-virtuous queen:
 O_Hamlet, what_a falling-off was there!
 From me, whose love was of_that dignity
 That_it went hand in hand even with_the vow
 I made_to her in marriage; and to decline
 Upon_a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
 To those of mine!
 But virtue, as_it never_will be mov'd,
 Though lewdness court it_in a shape_of heaven;
 So lust, though to_a radiant angel link'd,
 Will sate itself_in a celestial bed
 And prey on garbage.
 But_soft! methinks I scent the_morning air;
 Brief let_me be.—Sleeping within my_orchard,
 My custom always of_the afternoon,
 Upon_my secure hour thy uncle stole,
 With juice of cursed hebenon in_a vial,
 And_in the porches of_my ears did pour
 The leperous distilment; whose effect
 Holds such_an enmity with blood_of man
 That, swift as quicksilver, it courses through
 The natural gates and alleys of_the body;
 And_with a sudden vigour it_doth posset
 And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
 The thin and wholesome blood; so did it mine;
 And a_most instant tetter bark'd about,
 Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
 All my smooth body.
 Thus was I, sleeping, by_a brother's hand,
 Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:
 Cut off even_in the blossoms of_my sin,
 Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd;
 No reckoning made, but sent_to my account
 With_all my imperfections on_my head:
 O,_horrible! O,_horrible! most horrible!
 If_thou hast nature_in thee, bear_it not;
 Let_not the royal bed of_Denmark be
 A couch for luxury and damned incest.
 But, howsoever thou pursu'st this_act,
 Taint not_thy mind, nor let_thy soul contrive
 Against thy_mother aught: leave her to_heaven,
 And to_those thorns that in_her bosom lodge,
 To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!
 The glowworm shows the matin to_be near,
 And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:
 Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.
 [Exit.]

 Ham.
 O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?
 And shall_I couple hell? O, fie!—Hold, my_heart;
 And_you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
 But bear_me stiffly up.—Remember thee!
 Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
 In this distracted globe. Remember thee!
 Yea, from_the table of_my memory
 I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
 All saws of_books, all_forms, all pressures past,
 That youth_and observation copied there;
 And_thy commandment all_alone shall_live
 Within_the book and volume of_my brain,
 Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven!—
 O_most pernicious woman!
 O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
 My tables,—meet it_is I_set it down,
 That one may smile,_and smile,_and be_a villain;
 At_least, I_am sure, it may_be so in_Denmark:
 [Writing.]

 So, uncle, there you are. Now to_my word;
 It_is 'Adieu, adieu! remember me:'
 I_have sworn't.
 Hor.
 [Within.] My_lord, my_lord,—
 Mar.
 [Within.] Lord Hamlet,—
 Hor.
 [Within.] Heaven secure him!
 Ham.
 So be it!
 Mar.
 [Within.] Illo, ho,_ho, my_lord!
 Ham.
 Hillo, ho,_ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
 [Enter_Horatio and_Marcellus.]

 Mar.
 How_is't, my_noble lord?
 Hor.
 What news, my_lord?
 Ham.
 O, wonderful!
 Hor.
 Good_my lord, tell it.
 Ham.
 No; you'll reveal it.
 Hor.
 Not_I, my_lord, by heaven.
 Mar.
 Nor_I, my_lord.
 Ham.
 How_say you then; would heart_of man once think it?—
 But you'll be secret?
 Hor. and_Mar.
 Ay, by_heaven, my_lord.
 Ham.
 There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark
 But he's an arrant knave.
 Hor.
 There needs no ghost, my_lord, come_from the_grave
 To_tell us this.
 Ham.
 Why, right; you_are i'_the right;
 And so, without more circumstance at all,
 I_hold it fit that_we shake hands and part:
 You, as your business_and desires shall point you,—
 For every_man hath business_and desire,
 Such as_it is;—and for_my own poor part,
 Look_you, I'll_go pray.
 Hor.
 These are_but wild and whirling words, my_lord.
 Ham.
 I'm sorry they offend you, heartily;
 Yes, faith, heartily.
 Hor.
 There's no offence, my_lord.
 Ham.
 Yes, by_Saint Patrick, but_there is, Horatio,
 And much offence too. Touching_this vision here,—
 It_is an_honest ghost, that let_me tell you:
 For_your desire_to know_what is_between us,
 O'ermaster't as_you may. And_now, good_friends,
 As you_are friends, scholars, and soldiers,
 Give_me one poor request.
 Hor.
 What_is't, my_lord? we_will.
 Ham.
 Never make known what you_have seen to-night.
 Hor. and_Mar.
 My_lord, we_will not.
 Ham.
 Nay,_but swear't.
 Hor.
 In faith,
 My_lord, not I.
 Mar.
 Nor_I, my_lord, in faith.
 Ham.
 Upon_my sword.
 Mar.
 We have sworn, my_lord, already.
 Ham.
 Indeed, upon_my sword, indeed.
 Ghost.
 [Beneath.]_Swear.
 Ham.
 Ha, ha boy! say'st thou so? art_thou there, truepenny?—
 Come on!—you hear_this fellow in_the cellarage,—
 Consent to swear.
 Hor.
 Propose the oath, my_lord.
 Ham.
 Never_to speak_of this that_you have_seen,
 Swear_by my_sword.
 Ghost.
 [Beneath.]_Swear.
 Ham.
 Hic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground.—
 Come_hither, gentlemen,
 And lay your hands again upon_my sword:
 Never_to speak_of this that_you have_heard,
 Swear_by my_sword.
 Ghost.
 [Beneath.]_Swear.
 Ham.
 Well said, old mole! canst work i'_the earth so fast?
 A worthy pioner!—Once more remove, good friends.
 Hor.
 O day_and night, but_this is wondrous strange!
 Ham.
 And_therefore as_a stranger give_it welcome.
 There_are more things_in heaven_and earth, Horatio,
 Than are dreamt of in_your philosophy.
 But come;—
 Here, as_before, never, so help you mercy,
 How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,—
 As I, perchance, hereafter shall think meet
 To put an antic disposition on,—
 That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
 With arms encumber'd thus, or_this head-shake,
 Or_by pronouncing of_some doubtful phrase,
 As 'Well, well, we know'; or 'We could, an_if we would';—
 Or 'If we list to speak'; or 'There be, an_if they might';—
 Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
 That_you know aught_of me:—this is_not to_do,
 So grace_and mercy at_your most need help you,
 Swear.
 Ghost.
 [Beneath.]_Swear.
 Ham.
 Rest, rest, perturbed spirit!—So, gentlemen,
 With_all my_love I_do commend me_to you:
 And_what so poor a_man as Hamlet_is
 May do, to express his_love and friending to_you,
 God willing, shall_not lack. Let_us go in together;
 And still your fingers on_your lips, I pray.
 The_time is_out of joint:—O cursed spite,
 That ever_I was born to_set it right!—
 Nay, come, let's go together.
 [Exeunt.]

 Act II.

 Scene_I. A_room in_Polonius's house.

 [Enter Polonius and Reynaldo.]

 Pol.
 Give_him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
 Rey.
 I_will, my_lord.
 Pol.
 You_shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,
 Before You visit him, to_make inquiry
 Of_his behaviour.
 Rey.
 My_lord, I_did intend it.
 Pol.
 Marry,_well said; very_well said. Look_you, sir,
 Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
 And how, and who, what means,_and where they keep,
 What company, at what expense; and finding,
 By this encompassment and drift_of question,
 That_they do know_my son, come you more nearer
 Than your particular demands will touch it:
 Take you,_as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
 As thus, 'I know his_father and his friends,
 And_in part him;—do you_mark this, Reynaldo?
 Rey.
 Ay, very well,_my lord.
 Pol.
 'And in_part him;—but,' you_may say, 'not well:
 But if't_be he I_mean, he's very wild;
 Addicted so and so;' and_there put_on him
 What forgeries you_please; marry, none so rank
 As may dishonour him; take heed of_that;
 But, sir,_such wanton, wild, and usual slips
 As are companions noted and_most known
 To youth_and liberty.
 Rey.
 As gaming, my_lord.
 Pol.
 Ay,_or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
 Drabbing:—you may_go so far.
 Rey.
 My_lord, that_would dishonour him.
 Pol.
 Faith, no; as_you may season it_in the charge.
 You_must not put_another scandal on_him,
 That_he is open to incontinency;
 That's not my meaning: but breathe his_faults so quaintly
 That_they may seem the taints of liberty;
 The flash and outbreak of_a fiery mind;
 A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
 Of general assault.
 Rey.
 But,_my good_lord,—
 Pol.
 Wherefore should you_do this?
 Rey.
 Ay,_my lord,
 I_would know that.
 Pol.
 Marry, sir, here's my drift;
 And_I believe_it is_a fetch of warrant:
 You laying these slight sullies on_my son
 As 'twere a_thing a_little soil'd i'_the working,
 Mark you,
 Your party in converse, him you_would sound,
 Having ever seen_in the prenominate crimes
 The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur'd
 He_closes with_you in_this consequence;
 'Good sir,' or so; or 'friend,' or 'gentleman'—
 According to_the phrase or_the addition
 Of man_and country.
 Rey.
 Very good, my_lord.
 Pol.
 And_then, sir, does_he this,—he does—What was I about_to say?—
 By_the mass, I_was about_to say something:—Where did I leave?
 Rey. At 'closes in_the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and gentleman.'

 Pol.
 At—closes in_the consequence'—ay, marry!
 He_closes with_you thus:—'I know_the gentleman;
 I_saw him yesterday, or t'other day,
 Or then, or then; with such, or such; and,_as you_say,
 There was he gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
 There falling out_at tennis': or perchance,
 'I saw_him enter such_a house of sale,'—
 Videlicet, a brothel,—or so forth.—
 See you_now;
 Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:
 And_thus do_we of wisdom and of reach,
 With windlaces, and_with assays of bias,
 By indirections find directions out:
 So, by_my former lecture and advice,
 Shall you my son. You_have me, have_you not?
 Rey.
 My_lord, I have.
 Pol.
 God_b' wi'_you, fare you well.
 Rey.
 Good_my lord!
 Pol.
 Observe his inclination in yourself.
 Rey.
 I_shall, my_lord.
 Pol.
 And_let him ply his music.
 Rey.
 Well,_my lord.
 Pol.
 Farewell!
 [Exit Reynaldo.]

 [Enter Ophelia.]

 How_now, Ophelia! what's_the matter?

 Oph.
 Alas, my_lord, I_have been_so affrighted!
 Pol.
 With what, i'_the name_of God?
 Oph.
 My_lord, as_I was sewing in_my chamber,
 Lord Hamlet,—with his doublet all unbrac'd;
 No hat upon_his head; his stockings foul'd,
 Ungart'red, and down-gyved to_his ankle;
 Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;
 And_with a_look so_piteous in purport
 As_if he_had been loosed out_of hell
 To speak_of horrors,—he comes before me.
 Pol.
 Mad for_thy love?
 Oph.
 My_lord, I_do not know;
 But truly I_do fear it.
 Pol.
 What said he?
 Oph.
 He_took me_by the wrist, and held me hard;
 Then goes he to_the length of_all his arm;
 And_with his other hand thus o'er_his brow,
 He falls to_such perusal of_my face
 As_he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;
 At last,—a little shaking of_mine arm,
 And thrice his_head thus waving up_and down,—
 He rais'd a sigh so_piteous and profound
 As_it did_seem to shatter all_his bulk
 And end_his being: that done, he lets me go:
 And, with_his head over his shoulder turn'd
 He seem'd to_find his way without his eyes;
 For out_o' doors he_went without their help,
 And to_the last bended their light on me.
 Pol.
 Come,_go with_me: I_will go seek_the king.
 This_is the_very ecstasy of love;
 Whose violent property fordoes itself,
 And leads the will to desperate undertakings,
 As oft as any passion under heaven
 That does afflict our natures. I_am sorry,—
 What, have_you given him any hard words_of late?
 Oph.
 No,_my good lord; but,_as you_did command,
 I_did repel his letters and denied
 His access to_me.
 Pol.
 That_hath made him mad.
 I_am sorry that with better heed and_judgment
 I_had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,
 And meant_to wreck thee; but beshrew my jealousy!
 It seems_it as proper to_our age
 To_cast beyond ourselves_in our opinions
 As_it is common for_the younger sort
 To lack discretion. Come,_go we to_the king:
 This_must be known; which, being kept close, might move
 More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
 [Exeunt.]

 Scene_II. A_room in_the Castle.

 [Enter_King, Rosencrantz,_Guildenstern, and_Attendants.]

 King.
 Welcome, dear Rosencrantz_and Guildenstern!
 Moreover that_we much did long_to see you,
 The need we_have to_use you_did provoke
 Our hasty sending. Something have_you heard
 Of_Hamlet's transformation; so_I call it,
 Since nor_the exterior nor_the inward man
 Resembles that_it was. What it_should be,
 More_than his_father's death, that thus_hath put_him
 So_much from_the understanding of himself,
 I_cannot dream of: I entreat you both
 That, being of_so young days brought up with him,
 And since so neighbour'd to_his youth_and humour,
 That_you vouchsafe your rest here_in our court
 Some little time: so by_your companies
 To_draw him_on to pleasures, and to gather,
 So_much as from occasion you_may glean,
 Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,
 That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
 Queen.
 Good_gentlemen, he_hath much talk'd_of you,
 And sure I_am two men there_are not living
 To_whom he_more adheres. If_it will please_you
 To_show us so_much gentry and good-will
 As_to expend your time with_us awhile,
 For_the supply and profit of_our hope,
 Your visitation shall_receive such thanks
 As fits a king's remembrance.
 Ros.
 Both your_majesties
 Might, by_the sovereign power you_have of_us,
 Put_your dread pleasures more into command
 Than to entreaty.
 Guil.
 We both obey,
 And here give up ourselves, in_the full bent,
 To lay our service freely at_your feet,
 To_be commanded.
 King.
 Thanks, Rosencrantz_and gentle Guildenstern.
 Queen.
 Thanks, Guildenstern_and gentle Rosencrantz:
 And_I beseech_you instantly to_visit
 My too-much-changed son.—Go, some of you,
 And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
 Guil.
 Heavens make our presence and_our practices
 Pleasant and helpful to him!
 Queen.
 Ay, amen!
 [Exeunt Rosencrantz,_Guildenstern, and some Attendants].

 [Enter_Polonius.]

 Pol.
 Th' ambassadors from Norway, my_good lord,
 Are joyfully return'd.
 King.
 Thou still hast_been the father of good news.
 Pol.
 Have I,_my lord? Assure you,_my good liege,
 I_hold my duty, as_I hold_my soul,
 Both to_my God and to_my gracious king:
 And_I do think,—or else this brain of_mine
 Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
 As_it hath us'd to do,—that I_have found
 The_very cause_of Hamlet's lunacy.
 King.
 O,_speak of_that; that_do I long_to hear.
 Pol.
 Give first admittance to_the ambassadors;
 My news shall_be the fruit to that_great feast.
 King.
 Thyself do grace to them,_and bring them_in.
 [Exit_Polonius.]

 He tells me,_my sweet queen, he_hath found
 The_head and source_of all your son's distemper.
 Queen.
 I_doubt it_is no_other but_the main,—
 His father's_death and_our o'erhasty marriage.
 King.
 Well, we_shall sift him.
 [Enter_Polonius, with Voltimand_and Cornelius.]

 Welcome, my_good friends!
 Say, Voltimand, what from_our brother Norway?
 Volt.
 Most fair return of greetings and desires.
 Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
 His nephew's levies; which to_him appear'd
 To_be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;
 But, better look'd into, he truly found
 It_was against_your highness; whereat griev'd,—
 That so his sickness, age, and impotence
 Was falsely borne in hand,—sends out arrests
 On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;
 Receives rebuke from Norway; and,_in fine,
 Makes vow before his uncle never more
 To_give th' assay of arms_against your_majesty.
 Whereon old_Norway, overcome with joy,
 Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee;
 And his commission to employ those soldiers,
 So levied as_before, against_the Polack:
 With_an entreaty, herein further shown,
 [Gives a paper.]
 That_it might please_you to_give quiet pass
 Through your dominions for_this enterprise,
 On such regards of safety_and allowance
 As therein are set down.
 King.
 It likes us well;
 And_at our_more consider'd time we'll read,
 Answer, and_think upon_this business.
 Meantime we thank_you for_your well-took labour:
 Go_to your rest; at night we'll feast together:
 Most welcome home!
 [Exeunt_Voltimand and_Cornelius.]

 Pol.
 This business is well ended.—
 My liege, and madam,—to expostulate
 What majesty should_be, what duty is,
 Why day is day, night is night, and_time is time.
 Were nothing_but to waste night, day, and time.
 Therefore, since brevity is_the soul_of wit,
 And tediousness the limbs and_outward flourishes,
 I_will be brief:—your noble son is mad:
 Mad call I it; for_to define true madness,
 What is't but_to be_nothing else but mad?
 But_let that go.
 Queen.
 More matter, with less art.
 Pol.
 Madam,_I swear I use_no art at_all.
 That_he is_mad, 'tis_true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
 And pity 'tis 'tis_true: a_foolish figure;
 But farewell it,_for I_will use_no art.
 Mad let_us grant him then: and_now remains
 That_we find_out the_cause of_this effect;
 Or rather say,_the cause_of this defect,
 For_this effect defective comes_by cause:
 Thus it remains, and_the remainder thus.
 Perpend.
 I_have a daughter,—have whilst she_is mine,—
 Who, in_her duty and obedience, mark,
 Hath given_me this: now gather, and surmise.
 [Reads.]
 'To the celestial, and_my soul's idol, the_most beautified
 Ophelia,'—
 That's an ill phrase, a_vile phrase; 'beautified' is_a vile
 phrase: but you_shall hear. Thus:
 [Reads.]
 'In her excellent white bosom, these, &c.'
 Queen.
 Came this_from Hamlet to her?
 Pol.
 Good madam, stay awhile; I_will be faithful.
 [Reads.]
 'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
 Doubt that the_sun doth move;
 Doubt truth to_be a liar;
 But_never doubt I love.
 'O dear Ophelia,_I am ill at these numbers; I_have not art_to
 reckon my groans: but_that I_love thee best, O_most best, believe
 it. Adieu.
 'Thine evermore, most_dear lady, whilst_this machine is_to him,
 HAMLET.'
 This, in obedience, hath my_daughter show'd me;
 And more above, hath his solicitings,
 As they fell_out by_time, by means,_and place,
 All given to_mine ear.
 King.
 But how hath_she
 Receiv'd his love?
 Pol.
 What_do you_think of me?
 King.
 As of_a man faithful and honourable.
 Pol.
 I_would fain prove so. But_what might_you think,
 When_I had_seen this hot love_on the wing,—
 As_I perceiv'd it, I_must tell_you that,
 Before_my daughter told me,— what_might you,
 Or my_dear majesty your queen here, think,
 If I_had play'd the desk or table-book,
 Or given my_heart a winking, mute and dumb;
 Or look'd upon_this love with idle sight;—
 What_might you think? No, I went round to work,
 And my_young mistress thus I_did bespeak:
 'Lord Hamlet_is a prince, out_of thy sphere;
 This_must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,
 That she_should lock herself from_his resort,
 Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
 Which done, she took the fruits of_my advice;
 And he, repulsed,—a short tale_to make,—
 Fell into_a sadness; then into_a fast;
 Thence_to a watch; thence into_a weakness;
 Thence_to a lightness; and, by_this declension,
 Into_the madness wherein now_he raves,
 And_all we wail for.
 King.
 Do_you think 'tis this?
 Queen.
 It_may be, very likely.
 Pol.
 Hath there been such_a time,—I'd fain know that—
 That_I have positively said ''Tis so,'
 When it prov'd otherwise?
 King.
 Not_that I_know.
 Pol.
 Take this_from this, if_this be otherwise:
 [Points to_his head_and shoulder.]
 If circumstances lead me,_I will find
 Where truth is hid, though_it were hid indeed
 Within_the centre.
 King.
 How may we try it further?
 Pol.
 You_know sometimes he walks for hours together
 Here_in the_lobby.
 Queen.
 So he does indeed.
 Pol.
 At such_a time I'll loose my_daughter to_him:
 Be_you and I behind an arras then;
 Mark the encounter: if_he love her not,
 And_he not_from his reason fall'n thereon
 Let_me be_no assistant for_a state,
 But keep a farm and carters.
 King.
 We_will try it.
 Queen.
 But look_where sadly the_poor wretch comes reading.
 Pol.
 Away, I_do beseech_you, both away
 I'll board him presently:—O, give_me leave.
 [Exeunt King,_Queen, and_Attendants.]

 [Enter_Hamlet, reading.]

 How_does my_good Lord Hamlet?

 Ham.
 Well, God-a-mercy.
 Pol.
 Do_you know me,_my lord?
 Ham.
 Excellent well; you're a fishmonger.
 Pol.
 Not_I, my_lord.
 Ham.
 Then I_would you_were so honest a man.
 Pol.
 Honest, my_lord!
 Ham._Ay, sir; to_be honest, as_this world goes, is_to be one man picked out_of ten thousand.

 Pol.
 That's very true, my_lord.
 Ham._For if_the sun breed maggots in_a dead dog, being a god-kissing carrion,—Have you a daughter?

 Pol.
 I have, my_lord.
 Ham._Let her not walk i'_the sun: conception is_a blessing, but not as your daughter may conceive:—friend, look to't.

 Pol. How_say you by that?—[Aside.] Still harping on_my daughter:—yet he knew me_not at first; he said I_was a fishmonger: he_is far gone, far gone: and truly in_my youth I suffered much extremity for love; very near this. I'll_speak to_him again.—What do_you read,_my lord?

 Ham.
 Words, words, words.
 Pol.
 What_is the matter, my_lord?
 Ham.
 Between who?
 Pol.
 I_mean, the_matter that_you read,_my lord.
 Ham. Slanders, sir: for_the satirical slave says here that old men have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that_they have_a plentiful lack of_wit, together with_most weak hams: all which, sir, though_I most powerfully and potently believe, yet_I hold_it not honesty to have it thus set down; for you_yourself, sir, should_be old as_I am, if, like_a crab, you_could go backward.

 Pol.
 [Aside.] Though this_be madness, yet there_is a method in't.—
 Will_you walk out_of the_air, my_lord?
 Ham.
 Into my grave?
 Pol. Indeed, that_is out_o' the air. [Aside.] How pregnant sometimes his replies are! a happiness that often madness hits on, which reason_and sanity could_not so prosperously be delivered of. I_will leave him_and suddenly contrive the_means of meeting between him_and my daughter.—My honourable lord,_I will_most humbly take_my leave of_you.

 Ham._You cannot, sir, take from_me anything that_I will more willingly part withal,—except my_life, except_my life,_except my_life.

 Pol.
 Fare_you well,_my lord.
 Ham.
 These tedious old fools!
 [Enter_Rosencrantz and_Guildenstern.]

 Pol.
 You_go to_seek the_Lord Hamlet; there he is.
 Ros.
 [To_Polonius.] God save you,_sir!
 [Exit_Polonius.]

 Guil.
 My honoured lord!
 Ros.
 My most_dear lord!
 Ham.
 My excellent good_friends! How_dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah,
 Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
 Ros.
 As the indifferent children of_the earth.
 Guil.
 Happy in_that we_are not over-happy;
 On fortune's cap we_are not the_very button.
 Ham.
 Nor_the soles of_her shoe?
 Ros.
 Neither, my_lord.
 Ham._Then you live about her waist, or_in the middle_of her favours?

 Guil.
 Faith, her privates we.
 Ham._In the secret parts of fortune? O,_most true; she_is a strumpet. What's_the news?

 Ros.
 None, my_lord, but_that the_world's grown honest.
 Ham._Then is doomsday near; but your news is_not true. Let_me question more_in particular: what_have you,_my good_friends, deserved at_the hands of fortune, that_she sends you_to prison hither?

 Guil.
 Prison, my_lord!
 Ham.
 Denmark's a_prison.
 Ros.
 Then_is the_world one.
 Ham._A goodly one; in_which there_are many confines, wards, and dungeons, Denmark being one o'_the worst.

 Ros.
 We think not so,_my lord.
 Ham._Why, then 'tis none to_you; for_there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes_it so: to_me it_is a_prison.

 Ros. Why, then, your ambition makes_it one; 'tis_too narrow for_your mind.

 Ham._O God,_I could be bounded in_a nutshell, and count myself a_king of_infinite space, were it_not that_I have bad dreams.

 Guil. Which dreams, indeed,_are ambition; for_the very substance of_the ambitious is merely the shadow of_a dream.

 Ham.
 A dream itself is_but a shadow.
 Ros. Truly, and I_hold ambition of_so airy and light a_quality that_it is_but a shadow's shadow.

 Ham._Then are our beggars bodies, and_our monarchs and outstretch'd heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to_the court? for, by_my fay, I_cannot reason.

 Ros._and Guild.
 We'll wait_upon you.
 Ham. No such matter: I_will not sort you with_the rest_of my servants; for, to_speak to you_like an_honest man, I_am most dreadfully attended. But,_in the beaten way_of friendship, what_make you at Elsinore?

 Ros.
 To visit you,_my lord; no_other occasion.
 Ham. Beggar that_I am, I_am even poor in thanks; but I_thank you: and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear_a halfpenny. Were you_not sent for? Is_it your_own inclining? Is_it a free visitation? Come, deal justly with_me: come, come; nay, speak.

 Guil.
 What_should we say,_my lord?
 Ham._Why, anything—but to_the purpose. You were_sent for; and_there is_a kind_of confession in_your looks, which your modesties have_not craft enough to colour: I_know the good king_and queen have_sent for_you.

 Ros.
 To_what end, my_lord?
 Ham._That you_must teach me. But_let me conjure you,_by the rights_of our fellowship, by_the consonancy of_our youth, by_the obligation of_our ever-preserved love,_and by what more dear_a better proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct with_me, whether you_were sent_for or no.

 Ros.
 [To Guildenstern.] What say_you?
 Ham._[Aside.] Nay,_then, I_have an eye of you.—If you love me, hold not off.

 Guil.
 My_lord, we_were sent for.
 Ham._I will tell_you why; so_shall my anticipation prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to_the king_and queen moult no feather. I_have of late,—but wherefore I_know not,—lost all_my mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed,_it goes so heavily with my disposition that_this goodly frame, the earth, seems to_me a sterile promontory; this_most excellent canopy, the_air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire,—why, it appears no_other thing_to me than_a foul_and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a_piece of work is man! How noble in reason! how infinite in faculties! in form_and moving, how express and admirable! in action how_like an angel! in apprehension, how_like a god! the beauty of_the world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to_me, what_is this quintessence of dust? Man delights_not me; no, nor woman neither, though by_your smiling you seem_to say_so.

 Ros.
 My_lord, there_was no_such stuff in_my thoughts.
 Ham.
 Why did_you laugh then, when_I said 'Man delights_not me'?
 Ros._To think, my_lord, if_you delight not in man, what lenten entertainment the_players shall_receive from you: we coted them on_the way; and hither are_they coming_to offer you service.

 Ham._He that plays the_king shall_be welcome,—his majesty shall_have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target; the lover shall_not sigh gratis; the humorous man_shall end_his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle o'_the sere; and_the lady shall say her mind freely, or_the blank verse shall halt for't. What players are they?

 Ros. Even those you_were wont_to take such delight in,—the tragedians of_the city.

 Ham._How chances it they travel? their residence, both_in reputation and profit, was better both ways.

 Ros._I think their inhibition comes_by the_means of_the late innovation.

 Ham._Do they_hold the_same estimation they_did when_I was_in the city? Are they so followed?

 Ros.
 No, indeed,_are they not.
 Ham.
 How comes it? do they grow rusty?
 Ros. Nay, their endeavour keeps in_the wonted pace: but_there is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases, that cry out on_the top_of question, and are_most tyrannically clapped for't: these_are now_the fashion; and_so berattle the common stages,—so they call them,—that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose-quills and dare scarce come thither.

 Ham._What, are_they children? who maintains 'em? How are_they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no_longer than they_can sing? will they_not say afterwards, if_they should grow themselves to common players,—as it_is most like, if their means are_no better,—their writers do them wrong to_make them exclaim against their_own succession?

 Ros. Faith, there_has been_much to_do on_both sides; and_the nation holds it_no sin to tarre them_to controversy: there was, for awhile, no money bid for argument unless the poet and_the player went to cuffs in_the question.

 Ham.
 Is't_possible?
 Guil.
 O,_there has_been much throwing about of brains.
 Ham.
 Do the boys carry it away?
 Ros.
 Ay,_that they do,_my lord; Hercules and his load too.
 Ham._It is_not very strange; for_my uncle is king_of Denmark,_and those_that would_make mouths_at him while my_father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats a-piece for_his picture in little. 'Sblood, there_is something_in this more_than natural, if philosophy could find_it out.

 [Flourish of trumpets within.]

 Guil.
 There_are the players.
 Ham. Gentlemen, you_are welcome_to Elsinore. Your hands, come:_the appurtenance of welcome is fashion_and ceremony: let_me comply_with you_in this garb; lest my extent to_the players, which_I tell_you must show fairly outward, should more appear like entertainment than yours. You_are welcome: but_my uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.

 Guil.
 In what, my_dear lord?
 Ham._I am_but mad north-north-west: when_the wind_is southerly I_know a hawk from_a handsaw.

 [Enter_Polonius.]

 Pol.
 Well be with_you, gentlemen!
 Ham. Hark you, Guildenstern;—and you too;—at each ear a hearer: that_great baby you_see there_is not yet out_of his swaddling clouts.

 Ros. Happily he's the_second time come_to them; for_they say an_old man is twice a child.

 Ham._I will prophesy he comes to_tell me of_the players; mark it.—You say right, sir: o' Monday morning; 'twas so indeed.

 Pol.
 My_lord, I_have news_to tell_you.
 Ham.
 My_lord, I_have news_to tell_you. When Roscius was an actor in
 Rome,—
 Pol.
 The actors are_come hither,_my lord.
 Ham.
 Buzz, buzz!
 Pol.
 Upon_my honour,—
 Ham.
 Then came each actor on_his ass,—
 Pol._The best actors in_the world, either for tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or poem unlimited: Seneca cannot_be too heavy nor Plautus too light. For_the law of writ and_the liberty, these_are the only men.

 Ham.
 O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what_a treasure hadst thou!
 Pol.
 What treasure had he, my_lord?
 Ham.
 Why—
 'One fair daughter, and no_more,
 The which_he loved passing well.'
 Pol.
 [Aside.] Still on_my daughter.
 Ham.
 Am_I not i'_the right, old Jephthah?
 Pol. If_you call me Jephthah, my_lord, I_have a daughter that_I love passing well.

 Ham.
 Nay, that follows not.
 Pol.
 What follows, then, my_lord?
 Ham._Why— 'As by lot, God wot,' and then, you_know, 'It came_to pass, as most like it was—' The first row of_the pious chanson will show_you more; for_look where my abridgment comes.

 [Enter four or five Players.]

 You_are welcome, masters; welcome, all:—I am_glad to_see thee well.—welcome, good friends.—O, my old friend! Thy face is valanc'd since_I saw_thee last; comest thou_to beard me_in Denmark?—What, my_young lady and mistress! By'r lady, your ladyship is nearer to_heaven than when_I saw_you last, by_the altitude of_a chopine. Pray God, your voice, like_a piece_of uncurrent gold, be_not cracked within_the ring.—Masters, you_are all welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers, fly at anything we see: we'll have_a speech straight: come, give_us a taste of_your quality: come, a passionate speech.

 I_Play.
 What speech,_my lord?
 Ham._I heard thee_speak me_a speech once,—but it_was never acted; or if_it was, not above once; for_the play, I_remember, pleased not the million, 'twas caviare to_the general; but_it was,—as I received it,_and others, whose judgments in_such matters cried in_the top_of mine,—an excellent play, well digested in_the scenes, set_down with as_much modesty as cunning. I_remember, one said there were no sallets in_the lines to_make the_matter savoury, nor no matter_in the_phrase that_might indite the_author of affectation; but called it_an honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and_by very much_more handsome than fine. One speech in it I chiefly loved: 'twas AEneas' tale_to Dido, and thereabout of it especially where_he speaks of Priam's slaughter: if_it live_in your memory, begin at_this line;—let me see, let_me see:—

 The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast,—

 it_is not so:— it begins with Pyrrhus:—

 'The rugged Pyrrhus,—he whose sable arms,
 Black as his_purpose, did_the night resemble
 When_he lay couched in_the ominous horse,—
 Hath now this dread and_black complexion smear'd
 With heraldry more dismal; head_to foot
 Now is_he total gules; horridly trick'd
 With blood_of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
 Bak'd and impasted with_the parching streets,
 That lend_a tyrannous and_a damned light
 To their vile murders: roasted in wrath and fire,
 And_thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,
 With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
 Old grandsire Priam seeks.'
 So, proceed you.

 Pol. 'Fore God, my_lord, well spoken, with good accent and good discretion.

 I_Play.
 Anon he finds him,
 Striking too short at Greeks: his antique sword,
 Rebellious to_his arm, lies where_it falls,
 Repugnant to command: unequal match'd,
 Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;
 But_with the whiff and wind_of his fell sword
 The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
 Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
 Stoops to_his base; and_with a hideous crash
 Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for lo! his sword,
 Which_was declining on_the milky head
 Of reverend Priam, seem'd i'_the air to stick:
 So, as_a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood;
 And,_like a neutral to_his will and matter,
 Did nothing.
 But as_we often see, against some storm,
 A silence in_the heavens,_the rack stand still,
 The bold winds speechless, and_the orb below
 As hush as death, anon the_dreadful thunder
 Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
 A roused vengeance sets him new a-work;
 And_never did_the Cyclops' hammers fall
 On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,
 With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
 Now falls on Priam.—
 Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,
 In general synod, take away her power;
 Break all_the spokes and fellies from_her wheel,
 And bowl the round nave down_the hill of_heaven,
 As low as to_the fiends!
 Pol.
 This_is too long.
 Ham.
 It_shall to_the barber's, with_your beard.—Pr'ythee say on.—
 He's for_a jig or a_tale of bawdry, or_he sleeps:—say on; come
 to Hecuba.
 I_Play.
 But who, O who, had_seen the mobled queen,—
 Ham.
 'The mobled queen'?
 Pol.
 That's good! 'Mobled queen' is good.
 I_Play.
 Run barefoot up_and down, threatening the flames
 With bisson rheum; a clout upon_that head
 Where late the diadem stood, and for_a robe,
 About her lank and_all o'erteemed loins,
 A blanket, in_the alarm of fear caught up;—
 Who this_had seen, with tongue_in venom steep'd,
 'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd:
 But_if the gods themselves did see her then,
 When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
 In mincing with_his sword her husband's limbs,
 The instant burst of clamour that_she made,—
 Unless things mortal move them not_at all,—
 Would_have made milch the_burning eyes of_heaven,
 And passion in_the gods.
 Pol. Look, whether he_has not turn'd his colour, and has tears in's eyes.—Pray you, no more!

 Ham._'Tis well. I'll_have thee_speak out_the rest_of this soon.— Good_my lord, will you_see the_players well bestowed? Do_you hear? Let_them be well used; for_they are_the abstracts and brief chronicles of_the time; after_your death you_were better have_a bad epitaph than_their ill report while you live.

 Pol.
 My_lord, I_will use them according to_their desert.
 Ham. Odd's bodikin, man, better: use every_man after his desert, and_who should scape whipping? Use them after_your own honour and dignity: the less they deserve, the_more merit is in_your bounty. Take them_in.

 Pol.
 Come, sirs.
 Ham.
 Follow him, friends: we'll hear_a play to-morrow.
 [Exeunt Polonius with_all the Players but_the First.]

 Dost_thou hear me, old friend? Can_you play 'The Murder of
 Gonzago'?
 I_Play.
 Ay,_my lord.
 Ham. We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for_a need, study a_speech of_some dozen or sixteen lines which_I would set_down and insert in't? could_you not?

 I_Play.
 Ay,_my lord.
 Ham.
 Very well.—Follow that lord; and_look you mock him not.
 [Exit First Player.]

 —My good_friends [to Ros._and Guild.], I'll leave you till night: you_are welcome_to Elsinore.

 Ros.
 Good_my lord!
 [Exeunt_Rosencrantz and_Guildenstern.]

 Ham.
 Ay, so, God_b' wi' ye!
 Now I_am alone.
 O,_what a rogue and peasant slave am_I!
 Is_it not monstrous that_this player here,
 But_in a fiction, in_a dream_of passion,
 Could force his_soul so to_his own conceit
 That_from her working all_his visage wan'd;
 Tears in_his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
 A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
 With forms to_his conceit? And_all for nothing!
 For Hecuba?
 What's Hecuba to_him, or_he to Hecuba,
 That_he should weep for_her? What_would he do,
 Had_he the motive and_the cue for passion
 That_I have? He would drown the stage with tears
 And cleave the_general ear with horrid speech;
 Make mad the guilty, and appal the free;
 Confound the ignorant, and amaze, indeed,
 The_very faculties of eyes_and ears.
 Yet I,
 A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,
 Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of_my cause,
 And_can say nothing; no, not_for a_king
 Upon_whose property and_most dear life
 A damn'd defeat was made. Am_I a coward?
 Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
 Plucks off_my beard and blows it_in my face?
 Tweaks me_by the nose? gives me the lie_i' the throat
 As deep as to_the lungs? who does me this, ha?
 'Swounds, I_should take it: for it_cannot be
 But_I am pigeon-liver'd, and lack gall
 To_make oppression bitter; or_ere this
 I_should have fatted all_the region kites
 With_this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain!
 Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
 O, vengeance!
 Why,_what an ass am_I! This_is most brave,
 That_I, the_son of_a dear_father murder'd,
 Prompted to_my revenge by heaven_and hell,
 Must, like_a whore, unpack my_heart with words
 And fall a-cursing like_a very drab,
 A scullion!
 Fie upon't! foh!—About, my brain! I_have heard
 That guilty creatures, sitting at_a play,
 Have by_the very_cunning of_the scene
 Been struck so to_the soul that presently
 They_have proclaim'd their malefactions;
 For murder, though_it have_no tongue, will_speak
 With most miraculous organ, I'll_have these players
 Play something like_the murder of_my father
 Before mine_uncle: I'll observe his_looks;
 I'll tent him_to the quick: if_he but blench,
 I_know my course. The spirit that_I have_seen
 May be_the devil: and_the devil hath_power
 To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
 Out_of my weakness and_my melancholy,—
 As_he is_very potent with_such spirits,—
 Abuses me_to damn me: I'll_have grounds
 More relative than this.—the play's the_thing
 Wherein I'll catch the conscience of_the king.
 [Exit.]

 ACT III.

 Scene_I. A_room in_the Castle.

 [Enter_King, Queen,_Polonius, Ophelia,_Rosencrantz, and
 Guildenstern.]
 King.
 And_can you,_by no drift_of circumstance,
 Get from_him why he puts on_this confusion,
 Grating so harshly all_his days_of quiet
 With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
 Ros.
 He_does confess he feels himself distracted,
 But from_what cause he_will by_no means speak.
 Guil.
 Nor_do we_find him forward to_be sounded,
 But, with_a crafty madness, keeps aloof
 When_we would bring_him on to_some confession
 Of_his true state.
 Queen.
 Did he receive you well?
 Ros.
 Most like_a gentleman.
 Guil.
 But_with much forcing of_his disposition.
 Ros.
 Niggard of question; but, of_our demands,
 Most free in_his reply.
 Queen.
 Did_you assay him
 To any pastime?
 Ros.
 Madam, it_so fell_out that certain players
 We o'er-raught on_the way: of_these we told him,
 And_there did_seem in_him a_kind of_joy
 To_hear of_it: they_are about_the court,
 And,_as I think, they_have already order
 This night to_play before him.
 Pol.
 'Tis most_true;
 And_he beseech'd me_to entreat your_majesties
 To_hear and see_the matter.
 King.
 With_all my_heart; and it_doth much content me
 To_hear him so inclin'd.—
 Good_gentlemen, give_him a further edge,
 And drive his purpose on to these delights.
 Ros.
 We shall,_my lord.
 [Exeunt_Rosencrantz and_Guildenstern.]

 King.
 Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
 For_we have closely sent_for Hamlet hither,
 That he, as_'twere by accident, may here
 Affront Ophelia:
 Her father_and myself,—lawful espials,—
 Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen,
 We may of their encounter frankly judge;
 And gather by him, as_he is behav'd,
 If't be_the affliction_of his_love or no
 That_thus he suffers for.
 Queen.
 I_shall obey you:—
 And_for your part, Ophelia,_I do wish
 That your_good beauties be_the happy cause
 Of_Hamlet's wildness: so_shall I_hope your virtues
 Will bring_him to_his wonted way again,
 To both your honours.
 Oph.
 Madam,_I wish it may.
 [Exit Queen.]

 Pol.
 Ophelia, walk you here.—Gracious, so_please you,
 We_will bestow ourselves.—[To Ophelia.] Read on_this book;
 That show_of such_an exercise may colour
 Your loneliness.—We are oft to blame in_this,—
 'Tis too_much prov'd,—that with devotion's visage
 And pious action we_do sugar o'er
 The Devil himself.
 King.
 [Aside.] O,_'tis too true!
 How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
 The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art,
 Is_not more ugly to_the thing that helps it
 Than_is my deed to_my most painted word:
 O_heavy burden!
 Pol.
 I_hear him coming: let's withdraw, my_lord.
 [Exeunt King_and Polonius.]

 [Enter_Hamlet.]

 Ham.
 To be, or not_to be,—that is_the question:—
 Whether 'tis nobler in_the mind to suffer
 The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
 Or_to take arms_against a sea of troubles,
 And by opposing end them?—To die,—to sleep,—
 No more; and_by a sleep to_say we end
 The heartache, and_the thousand natural shocks
 That flesh is heir to,—'tis a consummation
 Devoutly to_be wish'd. To die,—to sleep;—
 To sleep! perchance to dream:—ay, there's_the rub;
 For_in that sleep of death what dreams may come,
 When_we have shuffled off_this mortal coil,
 Must give_us pause: there's_the respect
 That makes calamity of_so long life;
 For_who would bear_the whips and scorns of time,
 The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
 The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,
 The insolence of office, and_the spurns
 That patient merit of_the unworthy takes,
 When_he himself might his quietus make
 With a bare bodkin? who_would these fardels bear,
 To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
 But_that the dread of something after death,—
 The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn
 No traveller returns,—puzzles the will,
 And_makes us rather bear those ills we_have
 Than fly to others that_we know_not of?
 Thus conscience does make cowards of_us all;
 And_thus the native hue of resolution
 Is sicklied o'er with_the pale cast_of thought;
 And enterprises of_great pith_and moment,
 With_this regard, their currents turn awry,
 And_lose the_name of action.—Soft you_now!
 The fair Ophelia!—Nymph, in_thy orisons
 Be all_my sins remember'd.
 Oph.
 Good_my lord,
 How_does your_honour for_this many_a day?
 Ham.
 I_humbly thank you; well, well, well.
 Oph.
 My_lord, I_have remembrances of yours
 That_I have longed long_to re-deliver.
 I_pray you, now receive them.
 Ham.
 No,_not I;
 I never_gave you aught.
 Oph.
 My honour'd_lord, you_know right well you did;
 And_with them words_of so sweet breath compos'd
 As made the things more rich; their perfume lost,
 Take these again; for_to the_noble mind
 Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
 There, my_lord.
 Ham.
 Ha, ha! are you honest?
 Oph.
 My lord?
 Ham.
 Are you fair?
 Oph.
 What_means your lordship?
 Ham._That if_you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no discourse to_your beauty.

 Oph.
 Could beauty, my_lord, have better commerce than with honesty?
 Ham._Ay, truly; for_the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from_what it_is to_a bawd than_the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness: this_was sometime a paradox, but_now the_time gives it proof. I_did love you once.

 Oph.
 Indeed,_my lord,_you made_me believe so.
 Ham._You should not_have believ'd me; for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but_we shall relish_of it:_I loved you not.

 Oph.
 I_was the_more deceived.
 Ham. Get_thee to_a nunnery: why wouldst_thou be_a breeder of sinners? I_am myself indifferent honest; but_yet I_could accuse me of_such things that_it were_better my_mother had_not borne me:_I am_very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with_more offences at my beck than I_have thoughts to_put them in, imagination to_give them shape, or time_to act them_in. What_should such fellows as_I do crawling between earth and heaven? We_are arrant knaves, all; believe none_of us. Go thy ways to_a nunnery. Where's your father?

 Oph.
 At home, my_lord.
 Ham._Let the doors be shut upon him,_that he may play the_fool nowhere but in's own house. Farewell.

 Oph.
 O, help him, you sweet heavens!
 Ham._If thou_dost marry, I'll give_thee this plague for_thy dowry,— be thou as chaste as ice, as_pure as_snow, thou_shalt not escape calumny. Get_thee to_a nunnery, go: farewell. Or, if_thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what monsters you_make of them. To a_nunnery, go; and quickly too. Farewell.

 Oph.
 O heavenly powers, restore him!
 Ham._I have_heard of_your paintings too, well enough; God hath_given you one face, and you_make yourselves another: you jig, you amble, and you lisp, and nickname God's creatures, and make_your wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I'll no_more on't; it_hath made_me mad._I say, we_will have_no more marriages: those_that are married already, all_but one, shall live; the_rest shall_keep as_they are. To a_nunnery, go.

 [Exit.]

 Oph.
 O,_what a_noble mind is here o'erthrown!
 The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,
 The expectancy and rose_of the_fair state,
 The glass of fashion_and the mould of form,
 The observ'd of_all observers,—quite, quite down!
 And I, of ladies most deject and wretched
 That suck'd the honey of_his music vows,
 Now see that noble and_most sovereign reason,
 Like sweet bells jangled, out_of tune and harsh;
 That unmatch'd form_and feature of blown youth
 Blasted with ecstasy: O, woe_is me,
 To_have seen what_I have_seen, see what_I see!
 [Re-enter King_and Polonius.]

 King.
 Love! his affections do_not that way tend;
 Nor what_he spake, though_it lack'd form a little,
 Was not_like madness. There's something_in his_soul
 O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
 And_I do doubt the hatch and_the disclose
 Will be some danger: which for_to prevent,
 I_have in quick determination
 Thus set_it down:—he shall with_speed to_England
 For_the demand of_our neglected tribute:
 Haply the seas, and countries different,
 With variable objects, shall expel
 This something-settled matter_in his heart;
 Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
 From fashion of himself. What_think you_on't?
 Pol.
 It_shall do well: but_yet do_I believe
 The origin and commencement of_his grief
 Sprung from neglected love.—How now,_Ophelia!
 You need not_tell us_what Lord Hamlet said;
 We heard_it all.—My lord, do as_you please;
 But_if you hold_it fit, after_the play,
 Let his queen mother all_alone entreat him
 To_show his grief: let_her be_round with him;
 And I'll_be plac'd, so_please you, in_the ear
 Of_all their conference. If_she find_him not,
 To England send him; or confine him where
 Your_wisdom best shall think.
 King.
 It_shall be so:
 Madness in great ones must_not unwatch'd go.
 [Exeunt.]

 Scene_II. A_hall in_the Castle.

 [Enter_Hamlet and certain Players.]

 Ham. Speak the speech, I_pray you,_as I pronounced it to_you, trippingly on_the tongue: but_if you mouth it,_as many of_your players do, I_had as lief the town crier spoke my lines. Nor_do not saw the_air too_much with_your hand, thus, but_use all gently: for in_the very torrent, tempest, and,_as I may_say, whirlwind of_passion, you_must acquire and beget a temperance that may_give it smoothness. O, it offends me_to the soul, to_hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very rags, to split the ears_of the groundlings, who, for_the most part, are capable of nothing_but inexplicable dumb shows and noise: I_would have such_a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant; it out-herods Herod: pray_you avoid it.

 I_Player.
 I warrant your_honour.
 Ham. Be not too tame neither; but let_your own discretion be_your tutor: suit the_action to_the word, the word to_the action; with_this special observance, that_you o'erstep not the modesty of nature: for anything so overdone is from_the purpose of playing, whose end, both at_the first and_now, was and is, to hold, as_'twere, the mirror up_to nature; to_show virtue her_own image, scorn her_own image, and_the very age and body_of the_time his form_and pressure. Now, this overdone, or come tardy off, though_it make_the unskilful laugh, cannot but make_the judicious grieve; the censure_of the_which one must in_your allowance, o'erweigh a_whole theatre of others. O,_there be players that_I have_seen play,—and heard others praise, and that highly,—not to_speak it profanely, that, neither having the accent of Christians, nor_the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and bellowed that_I have thought some of nature's journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they imitated humanity so abominably.

 I_Player.
 I_hope we_have reform'd that indifferently with_us, sir.
 Ham._O, reform it altogether. And_let those_that play your clowns speak_no more_than is set_down for them: for_there be of_them that_will themselves laugh, to_set on some_quantity of barren spectators to laugh too, though in_the meantime some necessary question_of the play be then to_be considered: that's villanous and_shows a_most pitiful ambition in_the fool that uses it. Go make_you ready.

 [Exeunt Players.]

 [Enter_Polonius, Rosencrantz,_and Guildenstern.]

 How_now, my_lord! will the_king hear_this piece_of work?

 Pol.
 And the_queen too, and that presently.
 Ham.
 Bid the_players make_haste.
 [Exit_Polonius.]

 Will_you two help to hasten them?

 Ros._and Guil.
 We_will, my_lord.
 [Exeunt_Ros. and_Guil.]

 Ham.
 What, ho, Horatio!
 [Enter Horatio.]

 Hor.
 Here, sweet lord, at_your service.
 Ham.
 Horatio, thou_art e'en as just a_man
 As e'er my conversation cop'd withal.
 Hor.
 O,_my dear lord,—
 Ham.
 Nay, do_not think_I flatter;
 For_what advancement may I_hope from thee,
 That no revenue hast, but thy good spirits,
 To feed and clothe thee? Why_should the_poor be flatter'd?
 No, let_the candied tongue lick absurd pomp;
 And crook the pregnant hinges of_the knee
 Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost_thou hear?
 Since my_dear soul was mistress of_her choice,
 And could of men distinguish, her election
 Hath seal'd thee_for herself: for_thou hast_been
 As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing;
 A_man that Fortune's buffets and rewards
 Hast ta'en with equal thanks: and bles'd are those
 Whose blood and_judgment are_so well commingled
 That_they are_not a pipe for Fortune's finger
 To sound what stop she please. Give_me that man
 That_is not passion's slave, and I_will wear him
 In_my heart's core, ay, in_my heart_of heart,
 As_I do thee.—Something too_much of this.—
 There_is a_play to-night before_the king;
 One scene of it_comes near_the circumstance,
 Which I_have told thee, of_my father's death:
 I_pr'ythee, when_thou see'st that act a-foot,
 Even with_the very comment of_thy soul
 Observe mine_uncle: if_his occulted guilt
 Do_not itself unkennel in_one speech,
 It_is a_damned ghost that_we have seen;
 And my imaginations are_as foul
 As Vulcan's stithy. Give_him heedful note;
 For I mine_eyes will rivet to_his face;
 And, after, we_will both our judgments join
 In censure_of his seeming.
 Hor.
 Well,_my lord:
 If_he steal aught the whilst_this play_is playing,
 And scape detecting, I_will pay the theft.
 Ham.
 They_are coming_to the_play. I_must be idle:
 Get you a place.
 [Danish march. A flourish. Enter King,_Queen, Polonius,_Ophelia,
 Rosencrantz,_Guildenstern, and_others.]
 King.
 How_fares our cousin Hamlet?
 Ham. Excellent, i' faith; of_the chameleon's dish: I eat the_air, promise-crammed: you_cannot feed capons so.

 King._I have nothing with_this answer, Hamlet; these words_are not mine.

 Ham._No, nor mine now. My_lord, you play'd once i'_the university, you say? [To_Polonius.]

 Pol.
 That did I,_my lord, and was accounted a_good actor.
 Ham.
 What did_you enact?
 Pol._I did enact Julius Caesar; I_was kill'd i'_the Capitol; Brutus killed me.

 Ham._It was_a brute part_of him_to kill so_capital a calf there.—Be the_players ready?

 Ros.
 Ay,_my lord; they stay upon_your patience.
 Queen.
 Come_hither, my_dear Hamlet, sit by me.
 Ham.
 No, good_mother, here's metal more attractive.
 Pol.
 O, ho! do_you mark that? [To the_King.]
 Ham.
 Lady, shall_I lie_in your_lap?
 [Lying down at Ophelia's feet.]
 Oph.
 No,_my lord.
 Ham.
 I_mean, my_head upon_your lap?
 Oph.
 Ay,_my lord.
 Ham.
 Do_you think_I meant country matters?
 Oph.
 I_think nothing, my_lord.
 Ham.
 That's a_fair thought_to lie between maids' legs.
 Oph.
 What is, my_lord?
 Ham.
 Nothing.
 Oph.
 You_are merry, my_lord.
 Ham.
 Who, I?
 Oph.
 Ay,_my lord.
 Ham._O, your_only jig-maker! What_should a_man do_but be merry? for_look you_how cheerfully my_mother looks, and_my father died within 's two hours.

 Oph.
 Nay, 'tis twice two months, my_lord.
 Ham._So long? Nay then, let_the devil wear black, for I'll_have a suit of sables. O_heavens! die two_months ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there's hope a_great man's memory may outlive his life half a year: but, by'r lady, he must build churches then; or_else shall_he suffer not thinking on, with_the hobby-horse, whose epitaph is 'For, O, for, O,_the hobby-horse is forgot!'

 [Trumpets sound. The dumb show enters.]

 [Enter_a King_and a Queen very lovingly; the_Queen embracing him_and he her. She kneels, and_makes show_of protestation unto him._He takes her up, and declines his_head upon_her neck: lays him down upon_a bank of flowers: she, seeing him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes_in a fellow, takes_off his crown, kisses it, pours poison_in the_king's ears, and exit. The Queen returns, finds the King dead, and_makes passionate action. The_Poisoner with_some three or four Mutes, comes_in again, seeming to lament with_her. The dead_body is carried away. The_Poisoner wooes the_Queen with gifts; she seems loth and unwilling awhile, but_in the_end accepts his love.]

 [Exeunt.]

 Oph.
 What_means this,_my lord?
 Ham.
 Marry, this_is miching mallecho; it means mischief.
 Oph.
 Belike this_show imports_the argument of_the play.
 [Enter Prologue.]

 Ham._We shall_know by_this fellow: the_players cannot keep counsel; they'll tell all.

 Oph.
 Will he tell_us what this_show meant?
 Ham._Ay, or_any show that you'll show him: be_not you ashamed to show, he'll not shame to_tell you_what it means.

 Oph.
 You_are naught, you_are naught: I'll mark the_play.
 Pro.
 For us,_and for our tragedy,
 Here stooping to_your clemency,
 We beg your hearing patiently.
 Ham.
 Is this a prologue, or_the posy of_a ring?
 Oph.
 'Tis brief, my_lord.
 Ham.
 As woman's love.
 [Enter_a King_and a Queen.]

 P._King.
 Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
 Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
 And thirty dozen moons with borrow'd sheen
 About the_world have times twelve thirties been,
 Since love our hearts, and Hymen did our hands,
 Unite commutual in_most sacred bands.
 P._Queen.
 So many journeys may the_sun and moon
 Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
 But, woe_is me,_you are_so sick of late,
 So far from cheer_and from your former state.
 That_I distrust you. Yet, though_I distrust,
 Discomfort you,_my lord,_it nothing must:
 For women's fear_and love holds quantity;
 In neither aught, or_in extremity.
 Now, what my_love is, proof hath_made you know;
 And as my_love is siz'd, my fear is so:
 Where love_is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
 Where little fears grow great, great_love grows there.
 P._King.
 Faith, I_must leave thee, love,_and shortly too;
 My operant powers their functions leave_to do:
 And_thou shalt live_in this_fair world behind,
 Honour'd, belov'd, and haply one as kind
 For husband shalt thou,—
 P._Queen.
 O, confound the rest!
 Such love must_needs be treason in_my breast:
 In second_husband let_me be accurst!
 None wed the_second but who kill'd the first.
 Ham.
 [Aside.] Wormwood, wormwood!
 P._Queen.
 The instances that second marriage move
 Are base respects of thrift, but none_of love.
 A second_time I kill my husband dead
 When second_husband kisses me_in bed.
 P._King.
 I_do believe you_think what now_you speak;
 But_what we_do determine oft we break.
 Purpose is_but the slave to memory;
 Of violent birth, but poor validity:
 Which_now, like fruit unripe, sticks on_the tree;
 But fall unshaken when_they mellow be.
 Most necessary 'tis that_we forget
 To_pay ourselves what to_ourselves is debt:
 What to_ourselves in passion we propose,
 The passion ending, doth the_purpose lose.
 The violence of either grief or joy
 Their own enactures with themselves destroy:
 Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
 Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
 This world is_not for aye; nor 'tis_not strange
 That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
 For_'tis a question left us yet_to prove,
 Whether love lead fortune, or_else fortune love.
 The great man down, you_mark his favourite flies,
 The poor advanc'd makes friends of enemies;
 And hitherto doth love_on fortune tend:
 For_who not needs shall never lack a friend;
 And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
 Directly seasons him_his enemy.
 But, orderly to end where_I begun,—
 Our wills and fates do so contrary run
 That our devices still are overthrown;
 Our thoughts are ours, their ends none_of our own:
 So think thou_wilt no second_husband wed;
 But die thy_thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
 P._Queen.
 Nor earth to_me give food, nor heaven light!
 Sport and repose lock from_me day_and night!
 To desperation turn my trust and hope!
 An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope!
 Each opposite that blanks the face of_joy
 Meet what_I would_have well, and it destroy!
 Both here_and hence pursue me lasting strife,
 If, once a widow, ever_I be wife!
 Ham.
 If_she should break it now! [To Ophelia.]
 P._King.
 'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile;
 My spirits grow dull, and fain I_would beguile
 The tedious day_with sleep.
 [Sleeps.]
 P._Queen.
 Sleep rock thy brain,
 And_never come mischance between us twain!
 [Exit.]

 Ham.
 Madam, how_like you this play?
 Queen.
 The lady protests too much, methinks.
 Ham.
 O, but she'll keep her word.
 King.
 Have_you heard the argument? Is_there no_offence in't?
 Ham._No, no! They do_but jest, poison_in jest; no_offence i'_the world.

 King.
 What_do you_call the play?
 Ham._The Mouse-trap. Marry, how? Tropically. This play_is the_image of_a murder done_in Vienna: Gonzago is_the duke's name; his wife, Baptista: you_shall see anon; 'tis_a knavish piece_of work: but what o' that? your majesty, and_we that_have free souls, it touches us not: let_the gall'd jade wince; our withers are unwrung.

 [Enter Lucianus.]

 This_is one Lucianus, nephew_to the King.

 Oph.
 You_are a_good chorus, my_lord.
 Ham._I could interpret between you and your love, if_I could see_the puppets dallying.

 Oph.
 You_are keen, my_lord, you_are keen.
 Ham.
 It_would cost you a groaning to_take off_my edge.
 Oph.
 Still better, and worse.
 Ham._So you_must take your husbands.—Begin, murderer; pox, leave thy damnable faces, and begin. Come:—'The croaking raven doth bellow for revenge.'

 Luc.
 Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and_time agreeing;
 Confederate season, else no creature seeing;
 Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
 With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
 Thy natural magic and dire property
 On wholesome life usurp immediately.
 [Pours the_poison into_the sleeper's ears.]

 Ham.
 He poisons him_i' the garden for's estate. His name's Gonzago:
 The story is extant, and written in very choice Italian; you
 shall_see anon how_the murderer gets the love_of Gonzago's wife.
 Oph.
 The_King rises.
 Ham.
 What, frighted with false fire!
 Queen.
 How_fares my_lord?
 Pol.
 Give o'er_the play.
 King.
 Give_me some light:—away!
 All.
 Lights, lights, lights!
 [Exeunt_all but Hamlet_and Horatio.]

 Ham.
 Why, let_the strucken deer go weep,
 The hart ungalled play;
 For some_must watch, while some_must sleep:
 So runs the_world away.—
 Would not this, sir,_and a forest of feathers—if the_rest of_my
 fortunes turn Turk with me,—with two Provincial roses on_my
 razed shoes, get me_a fellowship in_a cry of players, sir?
 Hor.
 Half a share.
 Ham.
 A whole one, I.
 For thou_dost know, O Damon dear,
 This realm dismantled was
 Of Jove_himself; and_now reigns here
 A very, very—pajock.
 Hor.
 You might have rhymed.
 Ham._O good_Horatio, I'll take_the ghost's word for_a thousand pound! Didst perceive?

 Hor.
 Very_well, my_lord.
 Ham.
 Upon_the talk of_the poisoning?—
 Hor.
 I_did very_well note him.
 Ham.
 Ah, ha!—Come, some_music! Come, the recorders!—
 For_if the_king like_not the comedy,
 Why then, belike he likes it_not, perdy.
 Come, some_music!
 [Enter_Rosencrantz and_Guildenstern.]

 Guil.
 Good_my lord, vouchsafe me_a word with you.
 Ham.
 Sir, a_whole history.
 Guil.
 The_king, sir—
 Ham.
 Ay,_sir, what of him?
 Guil.
 Is, in_his retirement, marvellous distempered.
 Ham.
 With drink, sir?
 Guil.
 No,_my lord; rather with choler.
 Ham._Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to_the doctor; for me_to put_him to_his purgation would_perhaps plunge him into far more choler.

 Guil._Good my_lord, put your discourse into some frame, and start not_so wildly from_my affair.

 Ham.
 I_am tame, sir:—pronounce.
 Guil._The queen, your mother, in_most great affliction_of spirit, hath sent me_to you.

 Ham.
 You_are welcome.
 Guil. Nay,_good my_lord, this courtesy is_not of_the right breed. If_it shall please_you to_make me_a wholesome answer, I_will do your mother's commandment: if_not, your_pardon and_my return shall_be the_end of_my business.

 Ham.
 Sir,_I cannot.
 Guil.
 What, my_lord?
 Ham. Make_you a_wholesome answer; my wit's diseased: but,_sir, such answer as_I can make, you_shall command; or rather, as_you say,_my mother: therefore no_more, but_to the matter: my_mother, you say,—

 Ros._Then thus she says: your behaviour hath struck her into amazement and admiration.

 Ham._O wonderful son, that_can so stonish a mother!—But is there_no sequel at_the heels of_this mother's admiration?

 Ros.
 She desires to_speak with_you in_her closet ere_you go_to bed.
 Ham._We shall_obey, were she ten_times our mother. Have_you any further trade with us?

 Ros.
 My_lord, you once_did love me.
 Ham.
 And_so I_do still, by these pickers and stealers.
 Ros._Good my_lord, what_is your cause_of distemper? you do, surely, bar the_door upon_your own liberty if_you deny your griefs to_your friend.

 Ham.
 Sir,_I lack advancement.
 Ros. How_can that_be, when_you have the_voice of_the king himself for_your succession in Denmark?

 Ham._Ay, sir, but 'While the grass grows'—the proverb is_something musty.

 [Re-enter the Players, with recorders.]

 O,_the recorders:—let me_see one.—To withdraw with you:—why do_you go about_to recover the_wind of me, as if_you would drive me_into a toil?

 Guil.
 O_my lord,_if my_duty be_too bold, my_love is_too unmannerly.
 Ham.
 I_do not well understand that. Will_you play_upon this pipe?
 Guil.
 My_lord, I_cannot.
 Ham.
 I_pray you.
 Guil.
 Believe me,_I cannot.
 Ham.
 I_do beseech_you.
 Guil.
 I_know, no touch of_it, my_lord.
 Ham._'Tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages with_your finger and thumb, give_it breath with_your mouth, and it_will discourse most eloquent music. Look_you, these_are the stops.

 Guil._But these cannot I command_to any utterance of harmony; I_have not the skill.

 Ham._Why, look_you now,_how unworthy a_thing you_make of me! You would play_upon me; you_would seem_to know_my stops; you_would pluck out_the heart_of my mystery; you_would sound me from_my lowest note to_the top_of my compass; and_there is much music, excellent voice, in_this little organ, yet cannot you_make it speak. 'Sblood, do_you think_I am easier to_be played on than_a pipe? Call me_what instrument you_will, though you_can fret me,_you cannot play_upon me.

 [Enter_Polonius.]

 God_bless you,_sir!

 Pol.
 My_lord, the_queen would_speak with_you, and presently.
 Ham.
 Do_you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape_of a camel?
 Pol.
 By_the mass, and 'tis like_a camel indeed.
 Ham.
 Methinks_it is_like a_weasel.
 Pol.
 It_is backed like_a weasel.
 Ham.
 Or_like a_whale.
 Pol.
 Very like_a whale.
 Ham._Then will I come_to my_mother by and by.—They fool me_to the_top of_my bent.—I will_come by and by.

 Pol.
 I_will say_so.
 [Exit.]

 Ham.
 By-and-by is easily said.
 [Exit_Polonius.]

 —Leave me, friends.

 [Exeunt Ros, Guil., Hor., and Players.]

 'Tis_now the_very witching time_of night,
 When churchyards yawn, and hell_itself breathes out
 Contagion to_this world: now could I drink hot blood,
 And_do such bitter business as_the day
 Would quake to look on. Soft! now_to my mother.—
 O heart, lose not_thy nature; let not ever
 The soul_of Nero enter this firm bosom:
 Let_me be_cruel, not unnatural;
 I_will speak daggers to_her, but_use none;
 My tongue and_soul in_this be hypocrites,—
 How in_my words somever she be shent,
 To_give them seals never, my_soul, consent!
 [Exit.]

 Scene_III. A_room in_the Castle.

 [Enter_King, Rosencrantz,_and Guildenstern.]

 King.
 I like him not; nor stands it safe with_us
 To_let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
 I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
 And_he to_England shall along with_you:
 The terms_of our estate may_not endure
 Hazard so_near us as doth hourly grow
 Out_of his lunacies.
 Guil.
 We_will ourselves provide:
 Most holy and religious fear it_is
 To_keep those many many bodies safe
 That live_and feed upon_your majesty.
 Ros.
 The single and peculiar life_is bound,
 With_all the strength and armour of_the mind,
 To_keep itself from 'noyance; but much_more
 That spirit upon whose weal depend and rest
 The lives of many. The cease of majesty
 Dies not alone; but like_a gulf doth draw
 What's near it_with it: it_is a massy wheel,
 Fix'd on_the summit_of the highest mount,
 To whose huge spokes ten_thousand lesser things
 Are mortis'd and adjoin'd; which, when it_falls,
 Each small annexment, petty consequence,
 Attends the boisterous ruin. Never alone
 Did the_king sigh, but with_a general groan.
 King.
 Arm you, I_pray you, to_this speedy voyage;
 For_we will fetters put upon_this fear,
 Which now goes too free-footed.
 Ros and_Guil.
 We_will haste us.
 [Exeunt_Ros. and_Guil.]

 [Enter_Polonius.]

 Pol.
 My_lord, he's going to_his mother's closet:
 Behind_the arras I'll convey myself
 To_hear the process; I'll_warrant she'll tax him home:
 And,_as you said, and wisely was it said,
 'Tis meet that some more audience than_a mother,
 Since_nature makes_them partial, should o'erhear
 The speech, of vantage. Fare_you well,_my liege:
 I'll_call upon you ere_you go_to bed,
 And tell_you what_I know.
 King.
 Thanks, dear my_lord.
 [Exit_Polonius.]

 O,_my offence_is rank, it smells to_heaven;
 It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,—
 A brother's murder!—Pray can_I not,
 Though inclination be_as sharp as will:
 My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent;
 And,_like a_man to double business bound,
 I_stand in pause where_I shall first begin,
 And both neglect. What_if this cursed hand
 Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,—
 Is_there not rain enough in_the sweet heavens
 To wash it white_as snow? Whereto serves mercy
 But_to confront the visage of offence?
 And_what's in prayer but_this twofold force,—
 To_be forestalled ere we come_to fall,
 Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
 My fault is past. But, O,_what form_of prayer
 Can serve my turn? Forgive_me my foul murder!—
 That cannot be; since_I am still possess'd
 Of those effects for which_I did_the murder,—
 My crown, mine_own ambition, and_my queen.
 May one be pardon'd and retain the offence?
 In_the corrupted currents of_this world
 Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice;
 And oft 'tis seen_the wicked prize itself
 Buys out_the law; but 'tis_not so above;
 There_is no shuffling;—there the_action lies
 In his_true nature; and_we ourselves compell'd,
 Even to_the teeth and forehead_of our faults,
 To_give in evidence. What then? what rests?
 Try what repentance can: what_can it_not?
 Yet what_can it when one cannot repent?
 O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
 O limed soul, that, struggling to_be free,
 Art more engag'd! Help, angels! Make assay:
 Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart, with strings of steel,
 Be soft as sinews of_the new-born babe!
 All may_be well.
 [Retires and kneels.]

 [Enter_Hamlet.]

 Ham.
 Now might I_do it pat, now_he is praying;
 And_now I'll do't;—and so he goes to_heaven;
 And_so am_I reveng'd.—that would_be scann'd:
 A villain kills my_father; and for that,
 I, his sole son, do this_same villain send
 To heaven.
 O,_this is hire and salary, not revenge.
 He_took my_father grossly, full_of bread;
 With_all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
 And how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?
 But_in our circumstance and course of thought,
 'Tis heavy_with him: and am I,_then, reveng'd,
 To take_him in_the purging of_his soul,
 When_he is fit and season'd for_his passage?
 No.
 Up, sword,_and know thou a_more horrid hent:
 When_he is drunk asleep; or_in his rage;
 Or in_the incestuous pleasure of_his bed;
 At gaming, swearing; or_about some act
 That has no relish_of salvation in't;—
 Then trip him,_that his_heels may kick at heaven;
 And_that his_soul may_be as damn'd and_black
 As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays:
 This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.
 [Exit.]

 [The_King rises and advances.]

 King.
 My words fly up, my thoughts remain below:
 Words without thoughts never to_heaven go.
 [Exit.]

 Scene_IV. Another_room in_the castle.

 [Enter_Queen and_Polonius.]

 Pol.
 He_will come straight. Look_you lay home to_him:
 Tell_him his pranks have_been too broad to bear with,
 And_that your grace hath screen'd and stood between
 Much heat_and him. I'll silence me e'en here.
 Pray_you, be_round with_him.
 Ham.
 [Within.] Mother, mother, mother!
 Queen.
 I'll_warrant you:
 Fear me not:—withdraw; I_hear him coming.
 [Polonius goes behind the_arras.]

 [Enter_Hamlet.]

 Ham.
 Now, mother, what's_the matter?
 Queen.
 Hamlet,_thou hast thy father_much offended.
 Ham.
 Mother, you_have my_father much_offended.
 Queen.
 Come,_come, you answer with an idle tongue.
 Ham.
 Go, go, you question with_a wicked tongue.
 Queen.
 Why, how now, Hamlet!
 Ham.
 What's_the matter now?
 Queen.
 Have_you forgot me?
 Ham.
 No,_by the rood, not so:
 You_are the Queen, your husband's brother's wife,
 And,—would it_were not so!—you are my_mother.
 Queen.
 Nay,_then, I'll set those to you that_can speak.
 Ham.
 Come,_come, and sit_you down; you_shall not budge;
 You_go not till_I set you up_a glass
 Where you_may see_the inmost part_of you.
 Queen.
 What wilt_thou do? thou_wilt not murder me?—
 Help, help, ho!
 Pol.
 [Behind.] What, ho! help, help, help!
 Ham.
 How now? a rat? [Draws.]
 Dead for_a ducat, dead!
 [Makes a_pass through_the arras.]

 Pol.
 [Behind.] O,_I am slain!
 [Falls and dies.]

 Queen.
 O me,_what hast_thou done?
 Ham.
 Nay,_I know not: is_it the king?
 [Draws forth Polonius.]

 Queen.
 O,_what a rash and bloody_deed is_this!
 Ham.
 A bloody deed!—almost as bad, good_mother,
 As_kill a_king and marry with_his brother.
 Queen.
 As_kill a king!
 Ham.
 Ay, lady, 'twas my word.—
 Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
 [To_Polonius.]
 I took thee_for thy better: take_thy fortune;
 Thou find'st to_be too busy is some danger.—
 Leave wringing of_your hands: peace! sit_you down,
 And_let me wring your heart: for_so I_shall,
 If_it be_made of penetrable stuff;
 If damned custom have_not braz'd it_so
 That_it is proof and bulwark against sense.
 Queen.
 What_have I done, that_thou dar'st wag thy tongue
 In noise so rude against me?
 Ham.
 Such an_act
 That blurs the grace_and blush of modesty;
 Calls virtue hypocrite; takes_off the rose
 From_the fair forehead_of an innocent love,
 And sets a blister there; makes marriage-vows
 As false as dicers' oaths: O, such_a deed
 As from_the body_of contraction plucks
 The_very soul, and sweet religion makes
 A rhapsody of words: heaven's face doth glow;
 Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
 With tristful visage, as against_the doom,
 Is thought-sick at_the act.
 Queen.
 Ah me,_what act,
 That roars so loud, and thunders in_the index?
 Ham.
 Look here upon_this picture, and on this,—
 The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
 See what_a grace was seated on_this brow;
 Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove_himself;
 An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
 A station like_the herald Mercury
 New lighted on_a heaven-kissing hill:
 A combination and_a form, indeed,
 Where every god did_seem to_set his seal,
 To_give the_world assurance of_a man;
 This was_your husband.—Look you now what follows:
 Here is_your husband, like_a milldew'd ear
 Blasting his wholesome brother. Have_you eyes?
 Could you on_this fair mountain leave_to feed,
 And batten on_this moor? Ha! have_you eyes?
 You_cannot call_it love; for at_your age
 The hey-day in_the blood is tame, it's humble,
 And waits upon_the judgment: and what judgment
 Would step from_this to this? Sense, sure, you have,
 Else could_you not_have motion: but sure that sense
 Is apoplex'd; for madness would_not err;
 Nor sense to ecstacy was ne'er so thrall'd
 But it reserv'd some_quantity of choice
 To serve in_such a difference. What devil was't
 That_thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
 Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
 Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
 Or but_a sickly part_of one true sense
 Could not_so mope.
 O shame! where_is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
 If_thou canst mutine in_a matron's bones,
 To flaming youth let virtue be_as wax,
 And melt in_her own fire: proclaim no shame
 When_the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
 Since frost itself as actively doth burn,
 And reason panders will.
 Queen.
 O_Hamlet, speak_no more:
 Thou turn'st mine_eyes into my very soul;
 And_there I_see such black and grained spots
 As will_not leave their tinct.
 Ham.
 Nay,_but to live
 In_the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
 Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
 Over the nasty sty,—
 Queen.
 O,_speak to_me no more;
 These words like daggers enter in_mine ears;
 No more, sweet Hamlet.
 Ham.
 A murderer and_a villain;
 A slave that_is not twentieth part the tithe
 Of_your precedent lord; a_vice of kings;
 A cutpurse of_the empire and_the rule,
 That_from a shelf the precious diadem stole
 And put it_in his pocket!
 Queen.
 No_more.
 Ham.
 A king_of shreds and patches!—
 [Enter_Ghost.]

 Save me and hover o'er me_with your wings,
 You heavenly guards!—What would your_gracious figure?
 Queen.
 Alas, he's mad!
 Ham.
 Do_you not_come your tardy son to chide,
 That, laps'd in time_and passion, lets go by
 The important acting of_your dread command?
 O, say!
 Ghost.
 Do_not forget. This visitation
 Is but_to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
 But,_look, amazement on thy_mother sits:
 O, step between her and her fighting soul,—
 Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works,—
 Speak_to her, Hamlet.
 Ham.
 How_is it_with you, lady?
 Queen.
 Alas,_how is't with_you,
 That_you do bend your eye on vacancy,
 And_with the incorporal air do hold discourse?
 Forth at_your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
 And,_as the sleeping soldiers in_the alarm,
 Your bedded hairs, like life in excrements,
 Start up_and stand an end. O gentle son,
 Upon_the heat_and flame_of thy distemper
 Sprinkle cool patience! Whereon do_you look?
 Ham.
 On him, on him! Look_you how pale he glares!
 His form_and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
 Would make_them capable.—Do not_look upon_me;
 Lest with_this piteous action you convert
 My stern effects: then what_I have to_do
 Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.
 Queen.
 To_whom do_you speak this?
 Ham.
 Do_you see nothing there?
 Queen.
 Nothing at all; yet all_that is I see.
 Ham.
 Nor did_you nothing hear?
 Queen.
 No, nothing_but ourselves.
 Ham.
 Why,_look you there! look how it steals away!
 My father, in_his habit_as he liv'd!
 Look, where_he goes, even now out_at the portal!
 [Exit_Ghost.]

 Queen.
 This_is the_very coinage of_your brain:
 This bodiless creation ecstasy
 Is very_cunning in.
 Ham.
 Ecstasy!
 My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,
 And_makes as healthful music: it_is not madness
 That_I have utter'd: bring_me to_the test,
 And_I the_matter will re-word; which madness
 Would gambol from. Mother, for love_of grace,
 Lay not_that flattering unction to_your soul
 That not your trespass, but_my madness speaks:
 It_will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
 Whilst rank corruption, mining all within,
 Infects unseen. Confess yourself to_heaven;
 Repent what's past; avoid what_is to_come;
 And_do not spread the compost on_the weeds,
 To_make them ranker. Forgive_me this my virtue;
 For_in the fatness of_these pursy times
 Virtue_itself of vice must pardon beg,
 Yea, curb and woo for leave_to do him good.
 Queen.
 O_Hamlet, thou_hast cleft my_heart in twain.
 Ham.
 O, throw away the worser part_of it,
 And live_the purer with_the other half.
 Good night: but go_not to_mine uncle's bed;
 Assume a virtue, if_you have it not.
 That monster custom, who all sense doth eat,
 Of habits evil, is angel yet in_this,—
 That to_the use_of actions fair_and good
 He likewise gives a frock or livery
 That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night;
 And_that shall lend_a kind_of easiness
 To the_next abstinence: the_next more easy;
 For use almost can change the_stamp of nature,
 And either curb the devil, or throw him out
 With wondrous potency. Once more, good-night:
 And_when you_are desirous to_be bles'd,
 I'll blessing beg of you.—For this_same lord
 [Pointing to Polonius.]
 I_do repent; but heaven hath pleas'd it so,
 To punish me_with this, and this with_me,
 That_I must_be their scourge and minister.
 I_will bestow him, and_will answer well
 The death I gave him. So again, good-night.—
 I_must be_cruel, only to_be kind:
 Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.—
 One word more, good lady.
 Queen.
 What shall_I do?
 Ham.
 Not this, by_no means, that_I bid you do:
 Let_the bloat king tempt_you again to bed;
 Pinch wanton on_your cheek; call_you his mouse;
 And_let him, for_a pair_of reechy kisses,
 Or paddling in_your neck with_his damn'd fingers,
 Make_you to ravel all_this matter out,
 That_I essentially am_not in madness,
 But mad in craft. 'Twere_good you let_him know;
 For_who that's but_a queen, fair, sober, wise,
 Would from_a paddock, from_a bat, a gib,
 Such dear concernings hide? who_would do so?
 No, in despite of sense_and secrecy,
 Unpeg the_basket on_the house's top,
 Let_the birds fly, and, like_the famous ape,
 To try conclusions, in_the basket creep
 And break your_own neck down.
 Queen.
 Be_thou assur'd, if words be_made of breath,
 And breath of life, I_have no life_to breathe
 What thou_hast said_to me.
 Ham.
 I_must to England; you_know that?
 Queen.
 Alack,
 I_had forgot: 'tis so concluded on.
 Ham.
 There's letters seal'd: and_my two schoolfellows,—
 Whom I_will trust as_I will adders fang'd,—
 They bear_the mandate; they must sweep my way
 And marshal me_to knavery. Let_it work;
 For_'tis the sport to have the enginer
 Hoist with_his own petard: and 't shall_go hard
 But_I will delve one yard below their mines
 And blow_them at_the moon: O,_'tis most sweet,
 When_in one line two crafts directly meet.—
 This man_shall set me packing:
 I'll lug the_guts into_the neighbour room.—
 Mother, good-night.—Indeed, this counsellor
 Is now most still, most secret, and_most grave,
 Who was_in life a_foolish peating knave.
 Come, sir, to draw toward an_end with you:—
 Good night, mother.
 [Exeunt severally; Hamlet, dragging out Polonius.]

 ACT IV.

 Scene_I. A_room in_the Castle.

 [Enter_King, Queen, Rosencrantz_and Guildenstern.]

 King.
 There's matter_in these sighs. These profound heaves
 You_must translate: 'tis fit we understand them.
 Where_is your son?
 Queen.
 Bestow this place on us_a little while.
 [To Rosencrantz_and Guildenstern, who go out.]

 Ah, my_good lord,_what have_I seen to-night!

 King.
 What, Gertrude? How_does Hamlet?
 Queen.
 Mad as_the sea and wind, when both contend
 Which_is the mightier: in_his lawless fit
 Behind_the arras hearing something stir,
 Whips out_his rapier, cries 'A rat, a rat!'
 And_in this brainish apprehension, kills
 The unseen good old man.
 King.
 O_heavy deed!
 It had_been so with_us, had we been there:
 His liberty is_full of threats to all;
 To_you yourself, to_us, to every one.
 Alas,_how shall this_bloody deed be answer'd?
 It_will be laid to_us, whose providence
 Should_have kept short, restrain'd, and_out of haunt
 This mad young man. But so_much was our love
 We_would not_understand what was most fit;
 But, like_the owner of_a foul disease,
 To_keep it from divulging, let_it feed
 Even on_the pith of life. Where_is he gone?
 Queen.
 To_draw apart the_body he_hath kill'd:
 O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
 Among a mineral of metals base,
 Shows itself pure: he weeps for what_is done.
 King.
 O_Gertrude, come_away!
 The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
 But we_will ship him hence: and this vile deed
 We_must with_all our majesty and skill
 Both countenance and excuse.—Ho, Guildenstern!
 [Re-enter Rosencrantz_and Guildenstern.]

 Friends both, go join you with_some further aid:
 Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
 And_from his_mother's closet hath_he dragg'd him:
 Go_seek him out; speak fair,_and bring the_body
 Into_the chapel. I_pray you, haste in_this.
 [Exeunt_Rosencrantz and_Guildenstern.]

 Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends;
 And_let them know both what_we mean to_do
 And_what's untimely done: so haply slander,—
 Whose whisper o'er_the world's diameter,
 As level as_the cannon_to his blank,
 Transports his poison'd shot,—may miss our name,
 And hit the woundless air.—O, come_away!
 My soul is_full of discord and dismay.
 [Exeunt.]

 Scene_II. Another_room in_the Castle.

 [Enter_Hamlet.]

 Ham.
 Safely stowed.
 Ros._and Guil.
 [Within.] Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
 Ham.
 What noise? who calls on Hamlet? O, here they come.
 [Enter_Rosencrantz and_Guildenstern.]

 Ros.
 What_have you done, my_lord, with_the dead body?
 Ham.
 Compounded it_with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
 Ros.
 Tell us_where 'tis, that_we may_take it thence,
 And bear_it to_the chapel.
 Ham.
 Do_not believe_it.
 Ros.
 Believe what?
 Ham._That I_can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides, to_be demanded of_a sponge!—what replication should_be made by_the son_of a king?

 Ros.
 Take you me for_a sponge, my_lord?
 Ham._Ay, sir; that soaks up_the King's countenance, his rewards, his authorities. But such officers do the_king best service in_the end: he keeps them, like_an ape, in_the corner of_his jaw; first mouthed, to_be last swallowed: when_he needs what you_have gleaned, it_is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you_shall be dry again.

 Ros.
 I understand you not,_my lord.
 Ham.
 I_am glad of_it: a_knavish speech sleeps in_a foolish ear.
 Ros._My lord,_you must_tell us_where the_body is and go_with us_to the_king.

 Ham.
 The body_is with_the king, but_the king_is not with_the body.
 The_king is_a thing,—
 Guil.
 A thing, my_lord!
 Ham.
 Of nothing: bring_me to_him. Hide fox, and_all after.
 [Exeunt.]

 Scene_III. Another_room in_the Castle.

 [Enter King,attended.]

 King.
 I_have sent_to seek_him and to_find the_body.
 How dangerous is_it that_this man goes loose!
 Yet must_not we_put the strong law on him:
 He's lov'd of_the distracted multitude,
 Who like_not in_their judgment, but their eyes;
 And_where 'tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd,
 But_never the offence. To_bear all smooth and even,
 This sudden sending him away must seem
 Deliberate pause: diseases desperate grown
 By desperate appliance are reliev'd,
 Or not_at all.
 [Enter Rosencrantz.]

 How_now! what hath befall'n?

 Ros.
 Where the_dead body_is bestow'd, my_lord,
 We cannot get from him.
 King.
 But_where is he?
 Ros.
 Without, my_lord; guarded, to_know your pleasure.
 King.
 Bring him before us.
 Ros.
 Ho, Guildenstern! bring in_my lord.
 [Enter_Hamlet and_Guildenstern.]

 King.
 Now,_Hamlet, where's Polonius?
 Ham.
 At supper.
 King.
 At supper! where?
 Ham._Not where_he eats, but where_he is eaten: a_certain convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your worm is_your only emperor for diet: we_fat all creatures else to fat us,_and we_fat ourselves for maggots: your fat king_and your lean beggar is_but variable service,—two dishes, but_to one table: that's_the end.

 King.
 Alas, alas!
 Ham._A man_may fish with_the worm that_hath eat_of a_king, and eat_of the fish that_hath fed of_that worm.

 King.
 What dost_thou mean by this?
 Ham. Nothing but_to show_you how a_king may_go a progress through_the guts of_a beggar.

 King.
 Where_is Polonius?
 Ham._In heaven: send thither to see: if_your messenger find_him not there, seek_him i'_the other place yourself. But, indeed, if_you find_him not within this month, you_shall nose him as_you go up_the stairs into_the lobby.

 King.
 Go_seek him there. [To some Attendants.]
 Ham.
 He_will stay till you come.
 [Exeunt Attendants.]

 King.
 Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,—
 Which we_do tender, as_we dearly grieve
 For that_which thou_hast done,—must send thee hence
 With fiery quickness: therefore prepare thyself;
 The bark is ready, and_the wind at help,
 The associates tend, and everything_is bent
 For England.
 Ham.
 For England!
 King.
 Ay, Hamlet.
 Ham.
 Good.
 King.
 So is_it, if_thou knew'st our purposes.
 Ham.
 I_see a cherub that sees them.—But, come; for England!—
 Farewell, dear mother.
 King.
 Thy loving father, Hamlet.
 Ham._My mother: father_and mother is man_and wife; man_and wife is_one flesh; and so,_my mother.—Come, for England!

 [Exit.]

 King.
 Follow him at foot; tempt him_with speed aboard;
 Delay it_not; I'll_have him hence to-night:
 Away! for everything_is seal'd and done
 That else leans on_the affair: pray_you, make_haste.
 [Exeunt_Rosencrantz and_Guildenstern.]

 And, England, if my_love thou hold'st at aught,—
 As my great power thereof may_give thee sense,
 Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
 After_the Danish sword,_and thy free awe
 Pays homage to us,—thou mayst not coldly set
 Our sovereign process; which imports at full,
 By letters conjuring to that effect,
 The present death_of Hamlet. Do it, England;
 For like_the hectic in_my blood he rages,
 And_thou must cure me: till_I know 'tis done,
 Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.
 [Exit.]

 Scene_IV. A plain in Denmark.

 [Enter_Fortinbras, and Forces marching.]

 For.
 Go, Captain, from_me greet the_Danish king:
 Tell_him that, by_his license, Fortinbras
 Craves the conveyance of_a promis'd march
 Over his kingdom. You_know the rendezvous.
 If that_his majesty would aught with_us,
 We_shall express our_duty in_his eye;
 And_let him know so.
 Capt.
 I_will do't, my_lord.
 For.
 Go softly on.
 [Exeunt_all For. and Forces.]

 [Enter_Hamlet, Rosencrantz,_Guildenstern, &c.]

 Ham.
 Good sir, whose powers are these?
 Capt.
 They_are of_Norway, sir.
 Ham.
 How purpos'd, sir, I_pray you?
 Capt.
 Against some part_of Poland.
 Ham.
 Who commands them, sir?
 Capt.
 The nephew_to old_Norway, Fortinbras.
 Ham.
 Goes it against_the main of Poland, sir,
 Or for_some frontier?
 Capt.
 Truly to_speak, and_with no addition,
 We go_to gain a_little patch of ground
 That_hath in it_no profit but_the name.
 To_pay five ducats, five, I_would not farm it;
 Nor will it yield to Norway or_the Pole
 A ranker rate, should_it be sold in fee.
 Ham.
 Why,_then the_Polack never_will defend it.
 Capt.
 Yes, it_is already garrison'd.
 Ham.
 Two thousand souls and twenty_thousand ducats
 Will_not debate the_question of_this straw:
 This_is the imposthume of much wealth and peace,
 That inward breaks, and_shows no cause without
 Why the_man dies.—I humbly_thank you,_sir.
 Capt.
 God_b' wi'_you, sir.
 [Exit.]

 Ros.
 Will't please_you go,_my lord?
 Ham.
 I'll_be with_you straight. Go a_little before.
 [Exeunt_all but_Hamlet.]

 How all occasions do inform against me
 And spur my dull revenge! What_is a_man,
 If his chief good and market of_his time
 Be but_to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.
 Sure he_that made us_with such large discourse,
 Looking before and after, gave_us not
 That capability and godlike reason
 To fust in us unus'd. Now, whether it_be
 Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
 Of thinking too precisely on_the event,—
 A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
 And ever three parts coward,—I do_not know
 Why yet_I live_to say 'This thing's to do;'
 Sith I_have cause, and will, and strength, and_means
 To do't. Examples, gross as earth, exhort me:
 Witness this army, of_such mass and charge,
 Led by_a delicate and tender prince;
 Whose spirit, with divine ambition puff'd,
 Makes mouths_at the invisible event;
 Exposing what_is mortal and unsure
 To all_that fortune, death, and_danger dare,
 Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to_be great
 Is_not to stir without great argument,
 But greatly to_find quarrel in_a straw
 When honour's at_the stake. How stand I,_then,
 That have_a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
 Excitements of_my reason_and my blood,
 And_let all sleep? while, to_my shame, I_see
 The imminent death_of twenty_thousand men
 That,_for a fantasy and trick of fame,
 Go_to their graves like beds; fight for_a plot
 Whereon the numbers cannot try the_cause,
 Which_is not tomb enough and continent
 To hide the slain?—O, from_this time forth,
 My_thoughts be bloody, or be_nothing worth!
 [Exit.]

 Scene_V. Elsinore._A room_in the_Castle.

 [Enter_Queen and_Horatio.]

 Queen.
 I_will not_speak with_her.
 Gent.
 She is importunate; indeed distract:
 Her mood will needs_be pitied.
 Queen.
 What_would she have?
 Gent.
 She speaks much_of her father; says she hears
 There's tricks i'_the world, and hems, and beats her heart;
 Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things_in doubt,
 That carry but half sense: her speech is nothing,
 Yet the unshaped use_of it_doth move
 The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
 And botch the words up fit to_their own thoughts;
 Which, as her winks, and nods, and gestures yield them,
 Indeed would_make one think there might_be thought,
 Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
 'Twere_good she were spoken with; for she may strew
 Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
 Queen.
 Let_her come_in.
 [Exit_Horatio.]

 To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is,
 Each toy seems Prologue to_some great amiss:
 So full_of artless jealousy is guilt,
 It spills itself_in fearing to_be spilt.
 [Re-enter Horatio with Ophelia.]

 Oph.
 Where_is the beauteous majesty_of Denmark?
 Queen.
 How_now, Ophelia?
 Oph._[Sings.]
 How should I your true love know
 From another one?
 By his cockle bat and' staff
 And his sandal shoon.
 Queen.
 Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
 Oph.
 Say you? nay, pray_you, mark.
 [Sings.]
 He_is dead_and gone, lady,
 He_is dead_and gone;
 At_his head a grass green turf,
 At_his heels a stone.
 Queen.
 Nay,_but Ophelia—
 Oph.
 Pray_you, mark.
 [Sings.]
 White his shroud as_the mountain snow,
 [Enter King.]

 Queen.
 Alas, look here, my_lord!
 Oph.
 [Sings.]
 Larded all with sweet flowers;
 Which bewept to_the grave did go
 With true-love showers.
 King.
 How do you, pretty lady?
 Oph.
 Well, God dild you! They say_the owl was_a baker's daughter.
 Lord, we_know what_we are, but know_not what_we may be. God be at
 your table!
 King.
 Conceit upon_her father.
 Oph.
 Pray_you, let's have_no words_of this; but when_they ask_you what
 it means, say_you this:
 [Sings.]
 To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day
 All in_the morning bedtime,
 And_I a_maid at_your window,
 To_be your Valentine.
 Then up he rose and donn'd his clothes,
 And dupp'd the chamber door,
 Let in_the maid, that out a_maid
 Never departed more.
 King.
 Pretty Ophelia!
 Oph.
 Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll_make an_end on't:
 [Sings.]
 By Gis and_by Saint Charity,
 Alack, and fie for_shame!
 Young men will do't if_they come to't;
 By cock, they_are to_blame.
 Quoth she, before_you tumbled me,
 You promis'd me_to wed.
 So would_I ha' done, by yonder sun,
 An thou hadst not_come to_my bed.
 King.
 How_long hath_she been thus?
 Oph._I hope all will_be well. We_must be patient: but I_cannot choose_but weep, to_think they would lay him_i' the cold ground. My brother shall_know of_it: and_so I_thank you for_your good counsel.—Come, my coach!—Good night, ladies;_good night,_sweet ladies;_good night, good_night.

 [Exit.]

 King.
 Follow her close; give her good watch, I_pray you.
 [Exit_Horatio.]

 O,_this is_the poison of deep grief; it springs
 All from_her father's death. O_Gertrude, Gertrude,
 When sorrows come, they_come not single spies,
 But_in battalions! First, her father slain:
 Next, your son gone; and he most violent author
 Of_his own just remove: the people muddied,
 Thick and and unwholesome in_their thoughts_and whispers
 For good Polonius' death; and_we have_done but greenly
 In hugger-mugger to inter him: poor Ophelia
 Divided from herself and her_fair judgment,
 Without_the which we_are pictures or mere beasts:
 Last, and as_much containing as all these,
 Her brother is in secret come_from France;
 Feeds on_his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,
 And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
 With pestilent speeches of_his father's death;
 Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
 Will nothing stick our person to arraign
 In ear and ear. O_my dear Gertrude, this,
 Like to_a murdering piece, in many places
 Give, me superfluous death.
 [A_noise within.]

 Queen.
 Alack, what noise_is this?
 King.
 Where are my Switzers? let_them guard the door.
 [Enter_a Gentleman.]

 What_is the_matter?

 Gent.
 Save yourself, my_lord:
 The ocean, overpeering of_his list,
 Eats not the flats with_more impetuous haste
 Than young Laertes, in_a riotous head,
 O'erbears your offices. The rabble call_him lord;
 And,_as the_world were now but_to begin,
 Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
 The ratifiers and props of every word,
 They cry 'Choose we! Laertes shall_be king!'
 Caps, hands, and tongues applaud it to_the clouds,
 'Laertes shall_be king! Laertes king!'
 Queen.
 How cheerfully on_the false trail they cry!
 O,_this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
 [A_noise within.]

 King.
 The doors are broke.
 [Enter Laertes, armed; Danes following.]

 Laer.
 Where_is this king?—Sirs, stand you all without.
 Danes.
 No, let's come_in.
 Laer.
 I_pray you,_give me_leave.
 Danes.
 We_will, we_will.
 [They retire without the door.]

 Laer.
 I_thank you:—keep the door.—O thou vile king,
 Give_me my_father!
 Queen.
 Calmly, good Laertes.
 Laer.
 That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;
 Cries cuckold to_my father; brands the harlot
 Even here, between_the chaste unsmirched brow
 Of my true mother.
 King.
 What_is the_cause, Laertes,
 That thy rebellion looks_so giant-like?—
 Let_him go, Gertrude; do_not fear our person:
 There's such divinity doth hedge a_king,
 That treason can but peep to what_it would,
 Acts little of_his will.—Tell me, Laertes,
 Why thou_art thus incens'd.—Let him_go, Gertrude:—
 Speak, man.
 Laer.
 Where_is my father?
 King.
 Dead.
 Queen.
 But_not by him.
 King.
 Let_him demand his fill.
 Laer.
 How_came he dead? I'll not_be juggled with:
 To hell, allegiance! vows, to_the blackest devil!
 Conscience and grace, to_the profoundest pit!
 I_dare damnation:—to this point I stand,—
 That both the worlds, I give to negligence,
 Let come what comes; only I'll_be reveng'd
 Most throughly for_my father.
 King.
 Who shall stay you?
 Laer.
 My will, not all_the world:
 And_for my means, I'll husband them so well,
 They shall_go far with little.
 King.
 Good Laertes,
 If_you desire_to know_the certainty
 Of_your dear father's_death, is't writ in_your revenge
 That, sweepstake, you_will draw both friend and foe,
 Winner and loser?
 Laer.
 None but his enemies.
 King.
 Will_you know them then?
 Laer.
 To_his good_friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;
 And,_like the kind life-rendering pelican,
 Repast them with my blood.
 King.
 Why, now_you speak
 Like a_good child and_a true gentleman.
 That_I am guiltless of_your father's_death,
 And am_most sensibly in grief for it,
 It_shall as level to_your judgment pierce
 As day does to_your eye.
 Danes.
 [Within] Let_her come_in.
 Laer.
 How_now! What noise_is that?
 [Re-enter Ophelia, fantastically dressed with straws and flowers.]

 O heat, dry up_my brains! tears seven times salt,
 Burn out_the sense_and virtue_of mine eye!—
 By_heaven, thy madness shall_be paid by weight,
 Till our scale turn the beam. O rose_of May!
 Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!—
 O_heavens! is't possible a young maid's wits
 Should be_as mortal as an_old man's life?
 Nature is fine in love; and_where 'tis fine,
 It sends some precious instance of itself
 After_the thing it loves.
 Oph.
 [Sings.]
 They bore him barefac'd on_the bier
 Hey no nonny, nonny, hey nonny
 And on_his grave rain'd many_a tear.—
 Fare_you well,_my dove!

 Laer.
 Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
 It could_not move thus.
 Oph._You must sing 'Down a-down, an you_call him a-down-a.' O, how_the wheel becomes it! It_is the_false steward, that stole his master's daughter.

 Laer.
 This nothing's more_than matter.
 Oph._There's rosemary, that's_for remembrance; pray, love, remember: and_there is pansies, that's_for thoughts.

 Laer.
 A document in madness,—thoughts and remembrance fitted.
 Oph._There's fennel for_you, and columbines:—there's rue for you;_and here's some for me:—we may_call it herb of_grace o' Sundays:—O, you_must wear your rue with_a difference.—There's a daisy:—I would give_you some violets, but_they wither'd all when my_father died:—they say he made a_good end,— [Sings.] For bonny sweet Robin is all_my joy,—

 Laer.
 Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
 She turns to favour and to prettiness.
 Oph.
 [Sings.]
 And_will he_not come_again?
 And_will he_not come_again?
 No, no, he_is dead,
 Go_to thy death-bed,
 He_never will_come again.
 His_beard was as white_as snow,
 All flaxen was_his poll:
 He_is gone, he_is gone,
 And_we cast away moan:
 God ha' mercy on_his soul!
 And of_all Christian souls, I_pray God.—God b'_wi' ye.

 [Exit.]

 Laer.
 Do_you see this, O God?
 King.
 Laertes, I_must commune with_your grief,
 Or you_deny me right. Go but apart,
 Make choice of whom your wisest friends you_will,
 And_they shall_hear and judge 'twixt you and me.
 If by direct or_by collateral hand
 They find us touch'd, we_will our kingdom give,
 Our crown, our life, and_all that_we call ours,
 To_you in satisfaction; but_if not,
 Be_you content to lend your_patience to_us,
 And_we shall jointly labour with_your soul
 To_give it due content.
 Laer.
 Let this_be so;
 His means_of death, his obscure burial,—
 No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er_his bones,
 No noble rite nor formal ostentation,—
 Cry to_be heard, as_'twere from_heaven to_earth,
 That_I must call't in question.
 King.
 So_you shall;
 And_where the offence_is let_the great axe fall.
 I_pray you_go with me.
 [Exeunt.]

 Scene VI. Another_room in_the Castle.

 [Enter_Horatio and_a Servant.]

 Hor.
 What are_they that_would speak_with me?
 Servant.
 Sailors, sir: they_say they_have letters_for you.
 Hor.
 Let_them come_in.
 [Exit Servant.]

 I_do not_know from_what part_of the_world
 I_should be greeted, if not_from Lord_Hamlet.
 [Enter Sailors.]

 I Sailor.
 God_bless you,_sir.
 Hor.
 Let_him bless thee too.
 Sailor. He shall, sir, an't please him. There's_a letter for_you, sir,—it comes from_the ambassador that_was bound for England; if_your name be Horatio, as_I am let to_know it is.

 Hor. [Reads.] 'Horatio, when_thou shalt have overlooked this, give_these fellows some means to_the king: they_have letters_for him. Ere we_were two days old at sea, a pirate of_very warlike appointment gave_us chase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we_put on_a compelled valour, and in_the grapple I boarded them: on_the instant they got clear of_our ship; so_I alone became their prisoner. They_have dealt with me like thieves of mercy: but_they knew what they_did; I_am to_do a_good turn for them. Let_the king have the letters I_have sent; and repair thou_to me_with as_much haste as thou_wouldst fly death. I_have words to_speak in_thine ear will make_thee dumb; yet are_they much too light for_the bore of_the matter. These good fellows will bring thee where_I am. Rosencrantz_and Guildenstern hold their course for England: of_them I_have much_to tell thee. Farewell. He_that thou knowest thine, HAMLET.'

 Come, I_will give_you way for these your letters;
 And do't the speedier, that_you may direct me
 To him_from whom you brought_them.
 [Exeunt.]

 Scene VII. Another_room in_the Castle.

 [Enter King_and Laertes.]

 King.
 Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
 And you_must put_me in_your heart for friend,
 Sith you_have heard,_and with_a knowing ear,
 That_he which hath your noble_father slain
 Pursu'd my_life.
 Laer.
 It well appears:—but tell_me
 Why you proceeded not against these feats,
 So crimeful and_so capital in_nature,
 As by_your safety, wisdom, all_things else,
 You mainly were stirr'd up.
 King.
 O, for two special reasons;
 Which may to_you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,
 But yet_to me they_are strong. The_queen his_mother
 Lives almost by_his looks; and for myself,—
 My virtue or my plague, be it either which,—
 She's so conjunctive to_my life and soul,
 That, as_the star moves not but_in his sphere,
 I_could not but_by her._The other motive,
 Why to_a public count I_might not_go,
 Is_the great_love the_general gender bear him;
 Who, dipping all_his faults in_their affection,
 Would, like_the spring that turneth wood to stone,
 Convert his gyves to graces; so_that my arrows,
 Too slightly timber'd for_so loud a wind,
 Would_have reverted to_my bow again,
 And not where_I had aim'd them.
 Laer.
 And_so have_I a_noble father lost;
 A sister driven into desperate terms,—
 Whose worth, if praises may_go back again,
 Stood challenger on mount of_all the_age
 For her perfections:—but my_revenge will come.
 King.
 Break not your sleeps for that:—you must_not think
 That_we are made_of stuff so flat and dull
 That_we can let our beard be shook with danger,
 And think_it pastime. You shortly_shall hear more:
 I_lov'd your_father, and_we love ourself;
 And that, I hope, will teach_you to imagine,—
 [Enter_a Messenger.]

 How_now! What news?

 Mess.
 Letters, my_lord, from Hamlet:
 This to_your majesty; this to_the queen.
 King.
 From Hamlet! Who brought them?
 Mess.
 Sailors, my_lord, they say; I_saw them not:
 They were given_me by Claudio:—he receiv'd them
 Of him_that brought_them.
 King.
 Laertes, you_shall hear them.
 Leave us.
 [Exit Messenger.]

 [Reads]'High and mighty,—You shall_know I_am set naked on_your kingdom. To-morrow shall_I beg leave_to see_your kingly eyes: when_I shall, first asking your_pardon thereunto, recount the occasions of_my sudden and more strange return. HAMLET.'

 What_should this mean? Are all_the rest come back?
 Or is_it some abuse, and no_such thing?
 Laer.
 Know you the hand?
 King.
 'Tis Hamlet's character:—'Naked!'—
 And_in a postscript here, he_says 'alone.'
 Can_you advise me?
 Laer.
 I_am lost in_it, my_lord. But_let him come;
 It warms the_very sickness in_my heart
 That_I shall_live and_tell him_to his teeth,
 'Thus didest thou.'
 King.
 If_it be_so, Laertes,—
 As how should_it be so? how otherwise?—
 Will_you be rul'd by me?
 Laer.
 Ay,_my lord;
 So_you will_not o'errule me_to a peace.
 King.
 To thine_own peace. If_he be now return'd—
 As checking at_his voyage, and that_he means
 No_more to undertake it,—I will_work him
 To exploit, now ripe in_my device,
 Under_the which_he shall_not choose_but fall:
 And_for his death no wind shall breathe;
 But_even his_mother shall uncharge the practice
 And_call it accident.
 Laer.
 My_lord, I_will be rul'd;
 The rather if_you could devise it_so
 That_I might_be the organ.
 King.
 It falls right.
 You_have been talk'd_of since your travel much,
 And_that in Hamlet's hearing, for_a quality
 Wherein they_say you shine: your sum of parts
 Did not together pluck such envy from_him
 As did that one; and that,_in my regard,
 Of the unworthiest siege.
 Laer.
 What part is that,_my lord?
 King.
 A_very riband in_the cap of youth,
 Yet needful too; for youth no_less becomes
 The light and careless livery that_it wears
 Than settled age his sables and his weeds,
 Importing health and graveness.—Two months since,
 Here was_a gentleman of Normandy,—
 I've seen myself, and serv'd against, the French,
 And_they can well on horseback: but_this gallant
 Had witchcraft in't: he grew unto his seat;
 And to_such wondrous doing brought his horse,
 As had_he been incorps'd and demi-natur'd
 With the brave beast: so_far he topp'd my thought
 That_I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
 Come short of_what he did.
 Laer.
 A Norman was't?
 King.
 A Norman.
 Laer.
 Upon_my life, Lamond.
 King.
 The_very same.
 Laer.
 I_know him well: he_is the brooch indeed
 And gem of_all the nation.
 King.
 He made confession of you;
 And gave_you such_a masterly report
 For art and exercise in_your defence,
 And_for your rapier most especially,
 That_he cried out, 'twould be_a sight indeed
 If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation
 He swore, had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
 If_you oppos'd them. Sir,_this report of_his
 Did Hamlet so envenom with_his envy
 That_he could nothing do_but wish and beg
 Your sudden coming o'er, to_play with_him.
 Now, out_of this,—
 Laer.
 What out_of this,_my lord?
 King.
 Laertes, was_your father dear_to you?
 Or are you_like the painting of_a sorrow,
 A face without a heart?
 Laer.
 Why ask_you this?
 King.
 Not_that I_think you_did not love your_father;
 But_that I_know love_is begun by_time,
 And_that I see, in passages of proof,
 Time qualifies the spark and fire of_it.
 There lives within_the very flame_of love
 A kind_of wick or snuff that_will abate it;
 And nothing is_at a like goodness still;
 For goodness, growing to_a plurisy,
 Dies in_his own too much: that_we would do,
 We_should do when we would; for_this 'would' changes,
 And_hath abatements and delays as_many
 As there_are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
 And_then this 'should' is_like a spendthrift sigh,
 That hurts by easing. But_to the_quick o'_the ulcer:—
 Hamlet comes back: what would_you undertake
 To_show yourself your_father's son in deed
 More_than in words?
 Laer.
 To cut his throat i'_the church.
 King.
 No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;
 Revenge should_have no bounds. But,_good Laertes,
 Will_you do this, keep close within your chamber.
 Hamlet return'd shall_know you_are come home:
 We'll_put on those shall praise your excellence
 And set a_double varnish on_the fame
 The Frenchman gave you; bring you_in fine together
 And wager_on your heads: he, being remiss,
 Most generous, and free_from all contriving,
 Will_not peruse the_foils; so_that with ease,
 Or with_a little shuffling, you_may choose
 A sword unbated, and,_in a_pass of practice,
 Requite him_for your_father.
 Laer.
 I_will do't:
 And_for that purpose I'll anoint my_sword.
 I bought an unction of_a mountebank,
 So mortal that, but dip a knife in_it,
 Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
 Collected from_all simples that_have virtue
 Under_the moon, can save the_thing from death
 This_is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point
 With_this contagion, that, if_I gall him slightly,
 It_may be death.
 King.
 Let's further think_of this;
 Weigh what convenience both of time_and means
 May fit us_to our shape: if_this should fail,
 And_that our drift look through_our bad performance.
 'Twere better not assay'd: therefore this project
 Should_have a back or second, that_might hold
 If_this did blast in proof. Soft! let_me see:—
 We'll make_a solemn wager_on your cunnings,—
 I ha't:
 When_in your motion you_are hot_and dry,—
 As make_your bouts more violent to that end,—
 And_that he calls for drink, I'll_have prepar'd him
 A chalice for_the nonce; whereon but sipping,
 If_he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
 Our purpose may hold there.
 [Enter Queen.]

 How_now, sweet queen!

 Queen.
 One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
 So fast they follow:—your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
 Laer.
 Drown'd! O, where?
 Queen.
 There_is a willow grows aslant a brook,
 That shows his hoar leaves in_the glassy stream;
 There with fantastic garlands did she come
 Of crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,
 That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
 But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them.
 There, on_the pendant boughs her coronet weeds
 Clamb'ring to hang, an envious sliver broke;
 When down her weedy trophies and herself
 Fell in_the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;
 And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up;
 Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes;
 As one incapable of_her own distress,
 Or_like a creature native and indu'd
 Unto that element: but long it could_not be
 Till that_her garments, heavy_with their drink,
 Pull'd the_poor wretch from_her melodious lay
 To muddy death.
 Laer.
 Alas, then she_is drown'd?
 Queen.
 Drown'd, drown'd.
 Laer.
 Too much_of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
 And_therefore I forbid my tears: but_yet
 It_is our trick; nature her custom holds,
 Let shame say what_it will: when these_are gone,
 The woman will_be out.—Adieu, my_lord:
 I_have a_speech of fire, that fain would blaze,
 But_that this folly douts it.
 [Exit.]

 King.
 Let's follow, Gertrude;
 How much I_had to_do to calm his rage!
 Now fear I this will_give it start again;
 Therefore let's follow.
 [Exeunt.]

 ACT V.

 Scene_I. A churchyard.

 [Enter two Clowns, with spades, &c.]

 1_Clown. Is she to_be buried in Christian burial when she wilfully seeks her_own salvation?

 2_Clown. I_tell thee she is; and_therefore make_her grave straight: the crowner hath sat on_her, and finds it Christian_burial.

 1_Clown. How_can that_be, unless she_drowned herself in_her own defence?

 2_Clown. Why,_'tis found so.

 1_Clown. It_must be se offendendo; it_cannot be else. For here lies_the point: if_I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act: and_an act hath three branches; it_is to act, to_do, and to perform: argal, she_drowned herself wittingly.

 2_Clown. Nay,_but hear you, goodman delver,—

 1_Clown. Give_me leave. Here lies_the water; good: here stands the_man; good: if_the man go_to this water and_drown himself, it_is, will he, nill he, he goes,—mark you that: but_if the water come_to him_and drown him,_he drowns not himself; argal, he_that is_not guilty of_his own death shortens not_his own life.

 2_Clown. But is_this law?

 1_Clown. Ay,_marry, is't—crowner's quest law.

 2_Clown. Will_you ha' the_truth on't? If_this had_not been_a gentlewoman, she_should have_been buried out_o' Christian_burial.

 1_Clown. Why, there thou say'st: and_the more pity that_great folk should_have countenance in_this world to drown or hang themselves more_than their even Christian.—Come, my spade. There_is no ancient gentlemen but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers: they_hold up Adam's profession.

 2_Clown. Was he a gentleman?

 1_Clown. He_was the_first that_ever bore arms.

 2_Clown. Why, he_had none.

 1_Clown. What, art_a heathen? How_dost thou understand the Scripture? The Scripture says Adam digg'd: could he dig without arms? I'll put_another question to_thee: if_thou answerest me_not to_the purpose, confess thyself,—

 2_Clown. Go to.

 1_Clown. What_is he_that builds_stronger than either the mason, the shipwright,_or the carpenter?

 2_Clown. The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a_thousand tenants.

 1_Clown. I like thy wit well, in_good faith: the_gallows does well; but how does_it well? it does_well to_those that_do ill: now, thou_dost ill to_say the_gallows is built stronger_than the church; argal, the_gallows may do well_to thee. To't again, come.

 2_Clown. Who builds_stronger than_a mason, a shipwright,_or a carpenter?

 1_Clown. Ay, tell_me that, and unyoke.

 2_Clown. Marry, now I_can tell.

 1_Clown. To't.

 2_Clown. Mass, I_cannot tell.

 [Enter_Hamlet and Horatio, at_a distance.]

 1_Clown. Cudgel thy brains no_more about it,_for your dull ass will_not mend his pace with beating; and when_you are asked this question next, say 'a grave-maker;' the houses he makes last till doomsday. Go, get thee_to Yaughan; fetch me_a stoup of liquor.

 [Exit Second Clown.]

 [Digs and sings.]

 In youth when_I did_love, did_love,
 Methought it_was very sweet;
 To contract, O,_the time for, ah, my behove,
 O, methought there_was nothing meet.
 Ham. Has this_fellow no feeling of_his business, that_he sings at grave-making?

 Hor.
 Custom hath_made it_in him_a property of easiness.
 Ham._'Tis e'en_so: the hand of little employment hath the daintier sense.

 1_Clown.
 [Sings.]
 But age, with_his stealing steps,
 Hath claw'd me_in his clutch,
 And_hath shipp'd me_into the land,
 As_if I_had never been such.
 [Throws_up a skull.]

 Ham._That skull had a tongue_in it,_and could sing once: how_the knave jowls it to_the ground,as if 'twere Cain's jawbone, that_did the_first murder! This_might be_the pate of_a politician, which this ass now o'erreaches; one that_would circumvent God, might it_not?

 Hor.
 It might, my_lord.
 Ham._Or of_a courtier, which could say 'Good morrow, sweet lord! How_dost thou, good lord?' This_might be my_lord such-a-one, that praised my_lord such-a-one's horse when_he meant_to beg it,—might it_not?

 Hor.
 Ay,_my lord.
 Ham._Why, e'en_so: and_now my Lady Worm's; chapless, and knocked about_the mazard with_a sexton's spade: here's fine revolution, an we had the trick to see't. Did these bones cost no_more the breeding but_to play at loggets with 'em? mine ache to_think on't.

 1_Clown.
 [Sings.]
 A pickaxe and_a spade, a_spade,
 For and_a shrouding sheet;
 O,_a pit_of clay_for to_be made
 For_such a_guest is_meet.
 [Throws_up another skull].

 Ham._There's another: why may_not that be_the skull of_a lawyer? Where_be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? why does_he suffer this rude knave now_to knock him about_the sconce with_a dirty shovel, and_will not_tell him of_his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might_be in's time a_great buyer of land, with_his statutes, his recognizances, his_fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries: is_this the fine of_his fines, and_the recovery of_his recoveries, to have his fine pate full_of fine dirt? will his vouchers vouch him no_more of_his purchases, and double ones too, than_the length and breadth of_a pair_of indentures? The_very conveyances of_his lands will scarcely lie_in this box; and must the inheritor himself have_no more, ha?

 Hor.
 Not_a jot more, my_lord.
 Ham.
 Is_not parchment made_of sheep-skins?
 Hor.
 Ay,_my lord, And of calf-skins too.
 Ham._They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in_that. I_will speak_to this fellow.—Whose grave's this, sir?

 1_Clown.
 Mine, sir.
 [Sings.]
 O,_a pit_of clay_for to_be made
 For_such a_guest is_meet.
 Ham.
 I_think it_be thine indeed, for_thou liest in't.
 1_Clown.
 You lie out on't, sir,_and therefore 'tis_not yours: for_my part,
 I_do not lie_in't, yet_it is mine.
 Ham._Thou dost lie_in't, to_be in't and_say it_is thine: 'tis_for the_dead, not_for the quick; therefore thou liest.

 1_Clown. 'Tis a quick lie, sir; 't will away again from_me to_you.

 Ham.
 What man dost_thou dig it for?
 1_Clown. For no man, sir.

 Ham.
 What woman then?
 1_Clown. For none neither.

 Ham.
 Who_is to_be buried in't?
 1_Clown. One that_was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.

 Ham._How absolute the_knave is! We_must speak by_the card, or equivocation will undo us. By_the Lord, Horatio, these three years I_have taken note of_it, the_age is grown so picked that the toe of_the peasant comes so_near the heel of_the courtier he galls his kibe.—How long hast_thou been_a grave-maker?

 1_Clown. Of_all the days i'_the year, I_came to't that day_that our_last King Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.

 Ham.
 How_long is that since?
 1_Clown. Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that: it_was the_very day_that young Hamlet was born,—he that_is mad, and sent_into England.

 Ham.
 Ay,_marry, why was be sent_into England?
 1_Clown. Why, because he_was mad: he_shall recover his wits there; or, if_he do_not, it's no great matter there.

 Ham.
 Why?
 1_Clown. 'Twill not he seen_in him there; there the men are_as mad as he.

 Ham.
 How_came he mad?
 1_Clown. Very strangely, they say.

 Ham.
 How strangely?
 1_Clown. Faith, e'en with losing his wits.

 Ham.
 Upon what ground?
 1_Clown. Why, here_in Denmark: I_have been sexton here, man_and boy, thirty years.

 Ham.
 How_long will a_man lie_i' the_earth ere he rot?
 1_Clown. Faith, if_he be_not rotten before_he die,—as we_have many pocky corses now-a-days that_will scarce hold_the laying in,—he will_last you_some eight year or nine year: a tanner will_last you nine year.

 Ham.
 Why he_more than another?
 1_Clown. Why, sir, his hide is so tann'd with_his trade that_he will keep out water a_great while; and your water is_a sore decayer of_your whoreson dead body. Here's a skull now; this skull hath lain in_the earth three-and-twenty years.

 Ham.
 Whose was it?
 1_Clown. A whoreson, mad fellow's it was: whose do_you think_it was?

 Ham.
 Nay,_I know not.
 1_Clown.
 A pestilence on_him for_a mad rogue! 'a pour'd a flagon of
 Rhenish on_my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick's
 skull, the_king's jester.
 Ham.
 This?
 1_Clown. E'en that.

 Ham._Let me see. [Takes the_skull.] Alas,_poor Yorick!—I knew him, Horatio; a_fellow of_infinite jest, of_most excellent fancy: he_hath borne me on_his back a_thousand times; and_now, how abhorred in_my imagination it is! my gorge rises at it. Here hung those lips that_I have kiss'd I_know not how oft. Where_be your gibes now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment, that were_wont to_set the_table on_a roar? Not one now,_to mock your_own grinning? quite chap-fallen? Now, get you_to my lady's chamber, and_tell her, let_her paint an inch thick, to_this favour she must come; make_her laugh at that.—Pr'ythee, Horatio, tell_me one thing.

 Hor.
 What's that,_my lord?
 Ham.
 Dost_thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i'_the earth?
 Hor.
 E'en so.
 Ham.
 And smelt so? Pah!
 [Throws down_the skull.]

 Hor.
 E'en so,_my lord.
 Ham._To what base uses we_may return, Horatio! Why may_not imagination trace the_noble dust of Alexander till_he find_it stopping a bung-hole?

 Hor.
 'Twere to_consider too curiously to_consider so.
 Ham._No, faith, not a jot; but_to follow him thither with modesty enough, and likelihood to lead it: as thus: Alexander died, Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is earth; of earth we make loam; and why of_that loam whereto he_was converted might they_not stop_a beer-barrel? Imperious Caesar, dead_and turn'd to clay, Might stop_a hole to_keep the_wind away. O, that that earth which kept_the world in awe Should patch a wall to expel the winter's flaw! But_soft! but soft! aside!—Here comes the_king.

 [Enter priests, &c, in procession; the corpse of Ophelia,
 Laertes, and Mourners following; King,_Queen, their Trains, &c.]
 The_queen, the courtiers: who is that_they follow?
 And_with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
 The corse they_follow did with desperate hand
 Fordo it own life: 'twas of_some estate.
 Couch we awhile and mark.
 [Retiring with Horatio.]

 Laer.
 What_ceremony else?
 Ham.
 That_is Laertes,
 A_very noble youth: mark.
 Laer.
 What_ceremony else?
 1_Priest.
 Her obsequies have_been as far enlarg'd
 As we_have warranties: her death was doubtful;
 And, but_that great command o'ersways the order,
 She should in ground unsanctified have lodg'd
 Till_the last trumpet; for charitable prayers,
 Shards, flints, and pebbles should_be thrown on_her,
 Yet here she_is allowed her virgin rites,
 Her maiden strewments, and_the bringing home
 Of bell and burial.
 Laer.
 Must there_no more_be done?
 1_Priest.
 No_more be done;
 We_should profane the service_of the_dead
 To sing a requiem and such rest to her
 As_to peace-parted souls.
 Laer.
 Lay her i'_the earth;—
 And_from her_fair and unpolluted flesh
 May violets spring!—I tell thee, churlish priest,
 A ministering angel shall my sister be
 When thou_liest howling.
 Ham.
 What, the_fair Ophelia?
 Queen.
 Sweets to_the sweet: farewell.
 [Scattering flowers.]
 I hop'd thou shouldst have_been my Hamlet's wife;
 I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
 And not_have strew'd thy grave.
 Laer.
 O, treble woe
 Fall ten_times treble on that cursed head
 Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
 Depriv'd thee of!—Hold off_the earth awhile,
 Till I_have caught her once more_in mine arms:
 [Leaps_into the_grave.]
 Now pile your dust upon_the quick and dead,
 Till of_this flat a mountain you_have made,
 To o'ertop old Pelion or_the skyish head
 Of blue Olympus.
 Ham.
 [Advancing.]
 What_is he whose grief
 Bears such_an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
 Conjures the wandering stars, and_makes them stand
 Like wonder-wounded hearers? this_is I,
 Hamlet the_Dane.
 [Leaps_into the_grave.]
 Laer.
 The devil take_thy soul!
 [Grappling with him.]
 Ham.
 Thou pray'st not well.
 I_pr'ythee, take_thy fingers from_my throat;
 For, though_I am_not splenetive and rash,
 Yet have_I in me something dangerous,
 Which let_thy wiseness fear: away thy hand!
 King.
 Pluck them asunder.
 Queen.
 Hamlet! Hamlet!
 All.
 Gentlemen!—
 Hor.
 Good_my lord, be quiet.
 [The Attendants part them,_and they_come out_of the_grave.]

 Ham.
 Why, I_will fight with_him upon_this theme
 Until my eyelids will_no longer wag.
 Queen.
 O_my son, what theme?
 Ham.
 I_lov'd Ophelia; forty thousand brothers
 Could not, with_all their quantity_of love,
 Make up_my sum.—What wilt_thou do for_her?
 King.
 O, he_is mad, Laertes.
 Queen.
 For love_of God, forbear him!
 Ham.
 'Swounds, show me_what thou'lt do:
 Woul't weep? woul't fight? woul't fast? woul't tear thyself?
 Woul't drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?
 I'll do't.—Dost thou come here to whine?
 To outface me_with leaping in_her grave?
 Be buried quick with her,_and so will I:
 And, if_thou prate of mountains, let_them throw
 Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
 Singeing his pate against_the burning zone,
 Make Ossa like_a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
 I'll rant as well as thou.
 Queen.
 This_is mere madness:
 And_thus a while the fit will_work on him;
 Anon, as patient as_the female dove,
 When that_her golden couplets are disclos'd,
 His silence will sit drooping.
 Ham.
 Hear you, sir;
 What_is the reason that_you use me thus?
 I_lov'd you ever: but_it is_no matter;
 Let Hercules himself do what_he may,
 The cat will mew, and dog will_have his day.
 [Exit.]

 King.
 I_pray thee, good_Horatio, wait_upon him.—
 [Exit_Horatio.]
 [To Laertes]
 Strengthen your_patience in_our last night's speech;
 We'll_put the_matter to_the present push.—
 Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.—
 This grave shall_have a living monument:
 An hour_of quiet shortly_shall we see;
 Till_then in patience our proceeding be.
 [Exeunt.]

 Scene_II. A_hall in_the Castle.

 [Enter_Hamlet and_Horatio.]

 Ham.
 So_much for this, sir: now let_me see_the other;
 You_do remember all_the circumstance?
 Hor.
 Remember it,_my lord!
 Ham.
 Sir,_in my_heart there_was a_kind of fighting
 That would_not let_me sleep: methought I lay
 Worse than_the mutinies in_the bilboes. Rashly,
 And prais'd be rashness for it,—let us know,
 Our indiscretion sometime serves us well,
 When our deep plots do fail; and that_should teach us
 There's_a divinity that shapes our ends,
 Rough-hew them how we_will.
 Hor.
 That_is most certain.
 Ham.
 Up from_my cabin,
 My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in_the dark
 Grop'd I to_find out them: had_my desire;
 Finger'd their packet; and,_in fine, withdrew
 To mine_own room again: making so bold,
 My fears forgetting manners, to unseal
 Their grand commission; where_I found, Horatio,
 O royal knavery! an exact command,—
 Larded with many several sorts of reasons,
 Importing Denmark's health, and England's too,
 With, ho! such bugs and goblins in_my life,—
 That,_on the supervise, no leisure bated,
 No,_not to stay the grinding of_the axe,
 My head should_be struck off.
 Hor.
 Is't_possible?
 Ham.
 Here's the commission: read it_at more leisure.
 But wilt_thou bear_me how I_did proceed?
 Hor.
 I_beseech you.
 Ham.
 Being thus benetted round_with villanies,—
 Or I_could make_a prologue_to my brains,
 They had begun the play,—I sat me down;
 Devis'd a_new commission; wrote it fair:
 I once_did hold it,_as our statists do,
 A baseness to write fair,_and labour'd much
 How to forget that learning; but,_sir, now
 It did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou know
 The effect_of what_I wrote?
 Hor.
 Ay, good_my lord.
 Ham.
 An earnest conjuration from_the king,—
 As England was_his faithful tributary;
 As love between them like_the palm might flourish;
 As peace should still her wheaten garland wear
 And stand a comma 'tween their amities;
 And many such-like as's of_great charge,—
 That,_on the view and know_of these contents,
 Without debatement further, more_or less,
 He should the bearers put to sudden death,
 Not shriving-time allow'd.
 Hor.
 How was this seal'd?
 Ham.
 Why, even_in that_was heaven ordinant.
 I_had my_father's signet in_my purse,
 Which_was the model of_that Danish seal:
 Folded the writ up in_the form_of the_other;
 Subscrib'd it: gave't the impression; plac'd it safely,
 The changeling never known. Now, the_next day
 Was our sea-fight; and what to_this was sequent
 Thou_know'st already.
 Hor.
 So Guildenstern_and Rosencrantz go to't.
 Ham.
 Why, man, they_did make love to_this employment;
 They_are not near my conscience; their defeat
 Does by their_own insinuation grow:
 'Tis dangerous when_the baser nature comes
 Between the pass and fell incensed points
 Of mighty opposites.
 Hor.
 Why,_what a_king is_this!
 Ham.
 Does it_not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon,—
 He_that hath kill'd my king,_and whor'd my mother;
 Popp'd in between_the election and_my hopes;
 Thrown out_his angle for_my proper life,
 And_with such cozenage—is't not perfect conscience
 To quit him_with this arm? and is't not_to be damn'd
 To_let this canker of_our nature come
 In further evil?
 Hor.
 It_must be shortly known to_him from_England
 What_is the issue of_the business there.
 Ham.
 It_will be short: the interim is mine;
 And a man's life_is no_more than to_say One.
 But_I am_very sorry, good_Horatio,
 That to_Laertes I forgot myself;
 For by_the image_of my_cause I_see
 The portraiture of his: I'll court his favours:
 But, sure, the bravery of_his grief did put_me
 Into a towering passion.
 Hor.
 Peace; who comes here?
 [Enter Osric.]

 Osr.
 Your_lordship is right welcome back_to Denmark.
 Ham.
 I_humbly thank_you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?
 Hor.
 No,_my good_lord.
 Ham. Thy state is_the more gracious; for 'tis_a vice to_know him._He hath_much land, and fertile: let a_beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at_the king's mess; 'tis_a chough; but,_as I_say, spacious in_the possession of dirt.

 Osr. Sweet lord,_if your_lordship were at leisure, I_should impart a_thing to you_from his majesty.

 Ham._I will receive_it with_all diligence of spirit. Put_your bonnet to_his right use; 'tis_for the_head.

 Osr.
 I_thank your lordship, t'is very hot.
 Ham.
 No, believe_me, 'tis very cold; the_wind is northerly.
 Osr.
 It_is indifferent cold, my_lord, indeed.
 Ham.
 Methinks_it is_very sultry and hot for_my complexion.
 Osr. Exceedingly, my_lord; it_is very sultry,—as 'twere—I cannot tell how. But,_my lord,_his majesty bade me signify to you that_he has_laid a_great wager_on your head. Sir,_this is_the matter,—

 Ham.
 I_beseech you, remember,—
 [Hamlet moves him_to put_on his hat.]
 Osr. Nay, in_good faith; for mine ease, in_good faith. Sir, here is newly come_to court Laertes; believe_me, an absolute gentleman, full_of most_excellent differences, of_very soft society and great showing: indeed, to_speak feelingly of_him, he_is the card or calendar of gentry; for you_shall find in_him the continent of_what part a_gentleman would see.

 Ham._Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;—though, I_know, to divide him inventorially would dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw neither, in respect of_his quick sail. But,_in the verity of extolment, I_take him_to be_a soul_of great article, and his infusion of_such dearth and rareness as, to_make true diction of_him, his semblable is his mirror, and_who else would trace him,_his umbrage, nothing more.

 Osr.
 Your_lordship speaks most infallibly of_him.
 Ham._The concernancy, sir? why do_we wrap the_gentleman in_our more rawer breath?

 Osr.
 Sir?
 Hor._Is't not possible to understand in another tongue? You_will do't, sir, really.

 Ham.
 What imports_the nomination of_this gentleman?
 Osr.
 Of Laertes?
 Hor.
 His purse is empty already; all's golden words_are spent.
 Ham.
 Of him, sir.
 Osr.
 I_know, you_are not ignorant,—
 Ham._I would_you did, sir; yet, in_faith, if_you did, it_would not much approve me.—Well, sir.

 Osr.
 You_are not ignorant of_what excellence Laertes is,—
 Ham._I dare_not confess that, lest I_should compare with_him in excellence; but_to know_a man well were to_know himself.

 Osr._I mean, sir, for_his weapon; but_in the imputation laid_on him by them, in_his meed he's unfellowed.

 Ham.
 What's his weapon?
 Osr.
 Rapier and dagger.
 Ham.
 That's two of_his weapons:—but well.
 Osr._The king,_sir, hath wager'd with_him six_Barbary horses: against_the which_he has imponed,_as I_take it, six_French rapiers and poniards, with_their assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so: three of_the carriages, in_faith, are very dear_to fancy, very responsive to_the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of_very liberal conceit.

 Ham.
 What call_you the carriages?
 Hor.
 I_knew you_must be edified by_the margent ere_you had done.
 Osr.
 The carriages, sir, are_the hangers.
 Ham._The phrase would_be more german to_the matter if_we could carry cannon by_our sides. I_would it_might be hangers till then. But, on: six_Barbary horses against six_French swords, their_assigns, and three liberal conceited carriages: that's_the French bet against_the Danish: why_is this all imponed,_as you_call it?

 Osr._The king,_sir, hath_laid that,_in a dozen passes between your and him,_he shall_not exceed you three hits: he_hath laid_on twelve for nine; and it_would come_to immediate trial if_your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.

 Ham.
 How if_I answer no?
 Osr.
 I_mean, my_lord, the opposition of_your person in trial.
 Ham._Sir, I_will walk here_in the_hall: if_it please his majesty, it_is the breathing time_of day_with me: let_the foils be brought, the_gentleman willing, and_the king hold his_purpose, I_will win for him if_I can; if_not, I_will gain nothing_but my shame and_the odd hits.

 Osr.
 Shall_I re-deliver you e'en so?
 Ham.
 To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.
 Osr.
 I commend my_duty to_your lordship.
 Ham.
 Yours, yours.
 [Exit Osric.]

 He_does well_to commend it himself; there_are no tongues else for's turn.

 Hor.
 This lapwing runs away_with the shell on_his head.
 Ham._He did comply_with his dug before_he suck'd it. Thus has he,—and many more of_the same bevy that_I know_the drossy age dotes on,— only got the tune of_the time_and outward habit of encounter; a_kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and through_the most fanned and winnowed opinions; and do_but blow_them to_their trial, the bubbles are out,

 [Enter_a Lord.]

 Lord. My_lord, his_majesty commended him_to you by young Osric, who brings back_to him_that you attend him_in the_hall: he sends to_know if_your pleasure hold to_play with Laertes, or that_you will take longer time.

 Ham.
 I_am constant to_my purposes; they_follow the_king's pleasure:
 if_his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever, provided
 I be_so able as now.
 Lord.
 The_King and Queen_and all are_coming down.
 Ham.
 In happy time.
 Lord.
 The_queen desires you_to use some gentle entertainment to
 Laertes before_you fall to play.
 Ham.
 She well instructs me.
 [Exit Lord.]

 Hor.
 You_will lose this wager, my_lord.
 Ham._I do_not think so; since he_went into France I_have been in continual practice: I_shall win at_the odds. But thou_wouldst not_think how ill all's here about my_heart: but_it is_no matter.

 Hor.
 Nay,_good my_lord,—
 Ham._It is_but foolery; but_it is such_a kind_of gain-giving as would_perhaps trouble a woman.

 Hor. If your mind dislike anything, obey it:_I will forestall their repair hither, and_say you_are not fit.

 Ham._Not a whit, we defy augury: there's a special providence in_the fall of_a sparrow. If_it be now, 'tis_not to_come; if_it be_not to come, it_will be now; if_it be_not now, yet_it will come:_the readiness is all: since no man has aught_of what_he leaves, what is't to leave betimes?

 [Enter_King, Queen, Laertes, Lords, Osric, and Attendants with foils &c.]

 King.
 Come, Hamlet, come,_and take this hand from me.
 [The_King puts Laertes' hand into Hamlet's.]

 Ham.
 Give_me your pardon, sir: I_have done you wrong:
 But pardon't, as_you are a_gentleman.
 This presence knows, and you_must needs have_heard,
 How I_am punish'd with sore distraction.
 What I_have done
 That might your_nature, honour, and exception
 Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
 Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet:
 If_Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,
 And_when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
 Then Hamlet does_it not, Hamlet denies it.
 Who does it, then? His madness: if't_be so,
 Hamlet_is of_the faction that_is wrong'd;
 His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
 Sir,_in this audience,
 Let my disclaiming from_a purpos'd evil
 Free me so_far in_your most generous thoughts
 That_I have shot my arrow o'er_the house
 And hurt my brother.
 Laer.
 I_am satisfied in_nature,
 Whose motive, in_this case, should stir me most
 To my_revenge. But_in my terms_of honour
 I_stand aloof; and_will no reconcilement
 Till by_some elder masters of known honour
 I_have a voice_and precedent of peace
 To_keep my name ungor'd. But till that_time
 I_do receive your offer'd love like love,
 And_will not wrong it.
 Ham.
 I_embrace it freely;
 And_will this brother's wager frankly play.—
 Give us the_foils; come_on.
 Laer.
 Come, one for me.
 Ham.
 I'll_be your foil, Laertes; in_mine ignorance
 Your skill shall, like_a star in_the darkest night,
 Stick fiery off indeed.
 Laer.
 You mock_me, sir.
 Ham.
 No,_by this hand.
 King.
 Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
 You_know the wager?
 Ham.
 Very_well, my_lord;
 Your grace has_laid the odds o'_the weaker side.
 King.
 I_do not_fear it; I_have seen you both;
 But since he's better'd, we_have therefore odds.
 Laer.
 This_is too heavy, let_me see another.
 Ham.
 This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
 [They prepare to play.]

 Osr.
 Ay,_my good_lord.
 King.
 Set me the stoups of wine upon_that table,—
 If_Hamlet give the_first or second hit,
 Or quit in answer of_the third exchange,
 Let all_the battlements their ordnance fire;
 The_king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath;
 And_in the cup an union shall_he throw,
 Richer than that_which four successive kings
 In Denmark's crown have worn. Give_me the cups;
 And_let the kettle to_the trumpet speak,
 The trumpet_to the cannoneer without,
 The cannons to_the heavens,_the heavens to_earth,
 'Now the_king drinks to Hamlet.'—Come, begin:—
 And_you, the judges, bear a wary eye.
 Ham.
 Come on, sir.
 Laer.
 Come, my_lord.
 [They_play.]

 Ham.
 One.
 Laer.
 No.
 Ham.
 Judgment!
 Osr.
 A hit, a_very palpable hit.
 Laer.
 Well;—again.
 King.
 Stay, give_me drink.—Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
 Here's to_thy health.—
 [Trumpets sound, and cannon shot_off within.]

 Give_him the cup.

 Ham.
 I'll play this bout first; set_it by awhile.—
 Come.—Another hit; what say_you?
 [They_play.]

 Laer.
 A touch, a touch, I_do confess.
 King.
 Our son shall win.
 Queen.
 He's fat, and scant of breath.—
 Here, Hamlet, take_my napkin, rub thy brows:
 The_queen carouses to_thy fortune, Hamlet.
 Ham.
 Good madam!
 King.
 Gertrude, do_not drink.
 Queen.
 I_will, my_lord; I_pray you pardon me.
 King.
 [Aside.] It_is the poison'd cup; it_is too late.
 Ham.
 I_dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by.
 Queen.
 Come, let_me wipe thy face.
 Laer.
 My_lord, I'll hit him now.
 King.
 I_do not think't.
 Laer.
 [Aside.] And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience.
 Ham.
 Come, for_the third, Laertes: you but dally;
 I_pray you pass with_your best violence:
 I_am afeard you_make a wanton of me.
 Laer.
 Say you so? come_on.
 [They_play.]

 Osr.
 Nothing, neither way.
 Laer.
 Have at you_now!
 [Laertes wounds Hamlet; then, in scuffling, they change rapiers, and Hamlet wounds Laertes.]

 King.
 Part them; they_are incens'd.
 Ham.
 Nay, come again!
 [The Queen falls.]

 Osr.
 Look to_the queen there, ho!
 Hor.
 They bleed on_both sides.—How is_it, my_lord?
 Osr.
 How_is't, Laertes?
 Laer.
 Why, as_a woodcock to_my own springe, Osric;
 I_am justly kill'd with_mine own treachery.
 Ham.
 How_does the Queen?
 King.
 She swoons to_see them bleed.
 Queen.
 No,_no! the drink,_the drink!—O my_dear Hamlet!—
 The drink,_the drink!—I am poison'd.
 [Dies.]

 Ham.
 O villany!—Ho! let_the door be lock'd:
 Treachery! seek it_out.
 [Laertes falls.]

 Laer.
 It_is here, Hamlet: Hamlet,_thou art slain;
 No medicine in_the world can do thee good;
 In thee there_is not half an hour_of life;
 The treacherous instrument is in_thy hand,
 Unbated and envenom'd: the_foul practice
 Hath turn'd itself on me; lo, here I lie,
 Never_to rise again: thy mother's poison'd:
 I_can no more:—the king, the_king's to_blame.
 Ham.
 The point envenom'd too!—
 Then, venom, to_thy work.
 [Stabs the_King.]

 Osric and Lords.
 Treason! treason!
 King.
 O, yet defend me, friends! I_am but hurt.
 Ham.
 Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,
 Drink off_this potion.—Is thy union here?
 Follow my_mother.
 [King dies.]

 Laer.
 He_is justly serv'd;
 It_is a poison temper'd by himself.—
 Exchange forgiveness with_me, noble Hamlet:
 Mine and_my father's_death come_not upon thee,
 Nor thine on me!
 [Dies.]

 Ham.
 Heaven make_thee free of it! I_follow thee.—
 I_am dead, Horatio.—Wretched queen, adieu!—
 You that look pale and tremble at_this chance,
 That_are but mutes or audience to_this act,
 Had I but time,—as this fell sergeant, death,
 Is strict in_his arrest,—O, I_could tell you,—
 But_let it be.—Horatio, I_am dead;
 Thou liv'st; report me and_my cause aright
 To the unsatisfied.
 Hor.
 Never believe it:
 I_am more an antique Roman than_a Dane.—
 Here's yet some liquor left.
 Ham.
 As thou'rt a_man,
 Give_me the cup; let go; by_heaven, I'll have't.—
 O_good Horatio, what_a wounded name,
 Things standing thus unknown, shall_live behind me!
 If_thou didst_ever hold me_in thy heart,
 Absent thee from felicity awhile,
 And_in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
 To_tell my story.—
 [March afar off, and shot within.]

 What warlike noise_is this?

 Osr.
 Young Fortinbras, with conquest come_from Poland,
 To the ambassadors of England gives
 This warlike volley.
 Ham.
 O,_I die, Horatio;
 The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit:
 I_cannot live_to hear_the news from England;
 But_I do prophesy the_election lights
 On Fortinbras: he_has my dying voice;
 So tell him, with_the occurrents, more and less,
 Which have solicited.—the rest is silence.
 [Dies.]

 Hor.
 Now cracks a_noble heart.—Good night,_sweet prince,
 And flights of angels sing thee_to thy rest!
 Why does_the drum come hither?
 [March within.]

 [Enter_Fortinbras, the English Ambassadors, and_others.]

 Fort.
 Where_is this sight?
 Hor.
 What_is it you_will see?
 If aught_of woe or wonder, cease your search.
 Fort.
 This quarry cries on havoc.—O proud death,
 What feast is toward in_thine eternal cell,
 That thou so_many princes at_a shot
 So bloodily hast struck?
 1 Ambassador.
 The sight is dismal;
 And_our affairs from_England come too late:
 The ears are senseless that_should give_us hearing,
 To_tell him_his commandment is fulfill'd
 That Rosencrantz_and Guildenstern are dead:
 Where should_we have our thanks?
 Hor.
 Not from_his mouth,
 Had it the ability of life_to thank_you:
 He_never gave commandment for their death.
 But since, so jump upon_this bloody question,
 You from_the Polack wars, and you_from England,
 Are here arriv'd, give order that these bodies
 High on_a stage be placed to_the view;
 And_let me speak_to the yet unknowing world
 How these things came about: so_shall you hear
 Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts;
 Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters;
 Of deaths put_on by cunning and forc'd cause;
 And, in_this upshot, purposes mistook
 Fall'n on_the inventors' heads: all_this can_I
 Truly deliver.
 Fort.
 Let_us haste to_hear it,
 And_call the noblest to_the audience.
 For me, with sorrow I_embrace my fortune:
 I_have some rights_of memory in_this kingdom,
 Which_now, to claim my vantage doth invite me.
 Hor.
 Of that_I shall_have also cause to_speak,
 And_from his mouth whose voice will_draw on more:
 But_let this_same be presently perform'd,
 Even while men's minds are wild: lest more mischance
 On plots and errors happen.
 Fort.
 Let four captains
 Bear Hamlet like_a soldier to_the stage;
 For_he was likely, had_he been put on,
 To_have prov'd most royally: and, for_his passage,
 The soldiers' music and_the rites of war
 Speak loudly for him.—
 Take up_the bodies.—Such a_sight as_this
 Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.
 Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
 [A dead march.]

 [Exeunt, bearing off_the dead bodies; after_the which a peal of ordnance is shot off.]
